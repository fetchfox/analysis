If he's rude, he's an entitled rich jerk. If he's kind, he's got \"privilege\". It's pretty tiring to have everything be about oppressing the poor, it's kind like taking a conversation hostage.

But getting Victor Orbán to write the foreword to the book is plenty to make me worry about his sense of entitlement.    reply            zpeti  19 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      You know you can actually like people with different political views to yourself. I think Zizek is a super nice guy, despite disagreeing with 90% of what he says. I still think he's a great person with a nice soul.    reply            timeon  16 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      I think intentionally spreading obvious lies, like Orban does, is not about `different political views`. I have same view as you in your second paragraph. But let's not put everything on same level. This is the danger of this era. I respect different political views I do not agree with. I do not respect populist's manipulation.    reply            watwut  11 hours ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      Orban is not a great person with a nice soul. And political disagreement in here is massive euphemism designed to make him sound better then he is.    reply            michaelmrose  9 hours ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      He's a buffoon without value or virtue. An ambassador who doesn't speak the language of the folks he represents. A writer sharing the contents of his empty head like a curator leading a tour of an empty museum. He doesn't need us to defend him nor does he particularly deserve a defense.    reply            majormajor  22 hours ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      Niceness in a tweet doesn't cost much. Passing time and getting entertainment from being an asshole to random people is super cheap compared to many alternatives, though.    reply            bee_rider  11 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      He’s an influencer. The tweets might cost much; he’s probably got a PR guy to write them.    reply            sickofparadox  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      I think that the people in the breadline would have better things to do than be rude on twitter. Or maybe not, it is a fun way to pass the time for some.    reply            morkalork  23 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      If you're in the breadline, hobbies and other idle time activities cost money in comparison to twitter that is \"free\". Don't be surprised the rhetoric is toxic like 4chan and its hordes of basement dwelling NEETs.    reply            paleotrope  1 day ago    | prev | next  [–]      I recently fell down a wikipedia rabbit hole and found the interesting story of \nArchduke Wilhelm of Austria. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Wilhelm_of_Austria It was interesting to read about the diverse opinions of the different parts of the Hapsburg.    reply            PhasmaFelis  1 day ago    | parent | next  [–]      \"Unemployed landowner\" is a pretty funny job status.    reply            jjeaff  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [6 more]     [flagged]             jazzyjackson  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Boo. Every landlord I ever had was retired, working full time to earn enough to buy second properties, or were a management company, so the landlord there is actually a CEO of a property management firm. If there's somebody renting property without doing any work they're probably better characterized as a slumlord.    reply            morkalork  23 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Last two landlords I've had were ReMax agents.

Plenty of scummy property management firms, too. I suspect they far outnumber your nice guy landlords. Kind of depressing that the grandparent comment got people angry enough to flag it into oblivion.
