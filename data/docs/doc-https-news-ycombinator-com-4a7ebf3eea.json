They can move your server but they can&#x27;t move the entire network, set up an encrypted tunnel between two distant physical servers and self destruct the moment that tunnel gets disrupted.<p>Some computers come with gyros&#x2F;accelerometers built in. My old HP laptop had some kind of head crash prevention that used that hardware. I know this, because Gnome thought it was a tablet style sensor and turned my screen upside down if I didn&#x27;t disable the sensor. Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors.<p>You could probably figure out if the server is being moved by measuring capacitance of the case, measuring accelerometers, maybe add a GPS dongle. Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn&#x27;t from inside a server room. You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn&#x27;t get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages.<p>Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn&#x27;t that hard with opencv if you&#x27;re dedicated enough.<p>You have to hide your security measures and never tell anyone, though, or they&#x27;ll just leave the server as-is and use the classic rubber hose exploit to make you give up the key material.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41534698&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341534698\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41535766'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41535766' href='vote?id=41535766&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=tbrownaw\" class=\"hnuser\">tbrownaw</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-13T22:25:17.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41535766\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41535766\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533647\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41534698\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41536920\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41535766\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; <i>Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn&#x27;t from inside a server room.</i><p>Incoming Bluetooth Low Energy announcements should have a receive power level associated with them.

Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power.<p>Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can&#x27;t know that the ring is no longer complete.<p>In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you&#x27;d first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety. [2]<p>I dare say this is more involved and riskier than simply carefully cutting into the equipment power cord. Also, good luck finding enough slack conductor behind a wall socket in order to pull this off.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.screwfix.com&#x2F;is&#x2F;image&#x2F;ae235&#x2F;15747_A1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.screwfix.com&#x2F;is&#x2F;image&#x2F;ae235&#x2F;15747_A1</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;JCNm9CX.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;JCNm9CX.png</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41538754&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341538754\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                        <tr class='athing comtr' id='41536053'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='4'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"160\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41536053' href='vote?id=41536053&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=giobox\" class=\"hnuser\">giobox</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-13T23:15:55.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41536053\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41536053\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533647\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41534436\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41534531\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41534481\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41536053\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">As far as i&#x27;m aware, often times they just plug into an open socket on an existing powerstrip that are so often used for PCs, no vampire-ing required. You can then unplug the powerstrip from the wall, it stays powered, inputing electricity through one of the sockets instead of drawing.<p>I guess a more elaborate version of the same idea can be done if the computer plugged directly to an outlet with two sockets too, removing the socket from the wall.<p>The only time I can forsee vampiring the cable being a thing would be if computer is directly plugged into a single socket outlet on the wall?<p>&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;erq4TO_a3z8?si=jzOqrzyu7LZLfJIm&amp;t=135\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;erq4TO_a3z8?si=jzOqrzyu7LZLfJIm&amp;t=135</a><p>&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiebetech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;hotplug-field-kit&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiebetech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;hotplug-field-kit&#x2F;</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41536053&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341536053\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                                    <tr class='athing comtr' id='41534481'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='0'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41534481' href='vote?id=41534481&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=theideaofcoffee\" class=\"hnuser\">theideaofcoffee</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-13T19:44:33.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41534481\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41534481\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533647\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41538140\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41534481\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">This is a great writeup! Especially for those that may want to DIY it, the how and the why and all of that, and not have to shell out for carrier-quality Layer 1 encryption devices. Nice to see that even off-the-shelf components can do it with relative ease at those rates. Also nice to see sane sysctl tunes as well. Anything to make an adversary&#x27;s day a bit harder. I low key love the explanation of old 10B5 taps, something that so well and truly dead, but the legacy carries on into everything new today.<p>This is actually a well-trodden area of datacenter interconnect (DCI) devices that do line-rate encryption (to crazy levels like 400G+) to protect those links that may have easily accessible fibers strung along poles, for instance, to prevent just the vampirism described in the post.

I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that&#x27;s just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge.<p>I spent close to a week optimizing my setup looking at kernel flame graphs and perf results, reading adapter-specific tuning guides and driver source, and can say that the <i>only</i> really meaningful performance optimizations (in both the Broadwell- and Zen3&#x2F;Vermeer-based implementations I tried) were disabling mitigations in the kernel (esp. on Zen3, that boosted performance by more than 20%), and getting CPU frequency scaling&#x2F;idle states sorted out correctly (which yielded much higher wins on the older Broadwell uarch, because power state transition appears to happen much quicker on Zen3).<p>As for the solution presented in the (on the whole really great; I love it!) article, I have my doubts about the effectiveness of the cargo-culted  &quot;sysctl tuning&quot; mentioned - TCP, for example, is simply not involved at all in the described setup, so &quot;tuning&quot; its buffer allocations cannot have any effect on the workload.<p>Kudos to the writers for solving their problem in a creative, cost-effective and maintainable way! :)<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man8&#x2F;tc-mirred.8.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man8&#x2F;tc-mirred.8.html</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41538140&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341538140\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41542566'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41542566' href='vote?id=41542566&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=dfc\" class=\"hnuser\">dfc</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T20:25:02.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41542566\">4 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41542566\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41538140\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41539016\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41542566\" n=\"2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\"><i>&gt; I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that&#x27;s just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge.</i><p>Can you elaborate on what is not transparent about 802.1q bridge in Linux?<p>I hear you on the system tuning.

Otherwise, the CPUs&#x2F;platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely. One can tweak things to reach a sweet spot in the middle, where you can achieve ~99% of the peak performance at very sensible idle power draw (i.e., ~25W when the link isn&#x27;t loaded).<p>With Zen3, this hardly mattered at all.<p>I also got to witness that using IPv4 for the wireguard &quot;overlay&quot; network yielded about 30% better performance than when using IPv6 with ULA prefixes.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.archlinux.org&#x2F;man&#x2F;x86_energy_perf_policy.8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.archlinux.org&#x2F;man&#x2F;x86_energy_perf_policy.8</a>\n[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;1&#x2F;cpupower\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;1&#x2F;cpupower</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41539143&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341539143\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41539349'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41539349' href='vote?id=41539349&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=sulandor\" class=\"hnuser\">sulandor</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T12:21:52.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41539349\">12 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41539349\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41538140\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41539143\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41533955\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41539349\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">tyvm<p>came across the epp thing once or twice but remained in the land of &#x27;echo performance |tee &#x2F;sys....&#x27;<p>if you can share anything related to your sweetspot<p>the v6-performance issue reeks of mtu</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41539349&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341539349\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                              <tr class='athing comtr' id='41533955'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='0'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41533955' href='vote?id=41533955&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=dathery\" class=\"hnuser\">dathery</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-13T18:46:59.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41533955\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41533955\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41538140\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41538165\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41533955\" n=\"15\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Really cool article, I enjoy reading through all the details behind the decision making.<p>Just spit-balling a little, but I wonder if Wireguard is the best tool here given that the author is only using it for a single point-to-point link and they control the devices on both ends. That CPU supports AES-NI and probably does it a lot faster than Wireguard&#x27;s ChaCha20 (hard to get numbers for their server CPU, but the tiny little x86 mini PC I use as my router does AES XTS at 43Gbps according to `cryptsetup benchmark`).<p>You might see better performance by tunneling the vxlan connection using a different technology which can use AES-NI? Then again, Wireguard is definitely still a good tool for stuff like this, and maybe the performance penalty isn&#x27;t a big deal here.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41533955&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341533955\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41536469'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41536469' href='vote?id=41536469&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=alphager\" class=\"hnuser\">alphager</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T00:22:41.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41536469\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41536469\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533955\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41534504\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41536469\" n=\"5\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">AES can only encrypt up to 64TB; after that you need to re-key.

XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that&#x27;s not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it&#x27;s not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways.<p>Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you&#x27;re implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard&#x27;s crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I&#x27;m not sure AES-GCM wouldn&#x27;t have been the best (albeit less cool) choice.<p>Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I&#x27;d bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41539518&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341539518\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41540673'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='6'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"240\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41540673' href='vote?id=41540673&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=tptacek\" class=\"hnuser\">tptacek</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T16:01:18.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41540673\">8 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41540673\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533955\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41539518\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41535779\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41540673\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">WireGuard is an instantiation of Noise, which slightly disfavors AES-GCM (see: the spec).

They can move your server but they can&#x27;t move the entire network, set up an encrypted tunnel between two distant physical servers and self destruct the moment that tunnel gets disrupted.<p>Some computers come with gyros&#x2F;accelerometers built in. My old HP laptop had some kind of head crash prevention that used that hardware. I know this, because Gnome thought it was a tablet style sensor and turned my screen upside down if I didn&#x27;t disable the sensor. Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors.<p>You could probably figure out if the server is being moved by measuring capacitance of the case, measuring accelerometers, maybe add a GPS dongle. Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn&#x27;t from inside a server room. You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn&#x27;t get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages.<p>Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn&#x27;t that hard with opencv if you&#x27;re dedicated enough.<p>You have to hide your security measures and never tell anyone, though, or they&#x27;ll just leave the server as-is and use the classic rubber hose exploit to make you give up the key material.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41534698&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341534698\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41535766'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41535766' href='vote?id=41535766&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=tbrownaw\" class=\"hnuser\">tbrownaw</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-13T22:25:17.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41535766\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41535766\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533647\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41534698\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41536920\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41535766\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; <i>Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn&#x27;t from inside a server room.</i><p>Incoming Bluetooth Low Energy announcements should have a receive power level associated with them.

Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power.<p>Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can&#x27;t know that the ring is no longer complete.<p>In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you&#x27;d first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety. [2]<p>I dare say this is more involved and riskier than simply carefully cutting into the equipment power cord. Also, good luck finding enough slack conductor behind a wall socket in order to pull this off.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.screwfix.com&#x2F;is&#x2F;image&#x2F;ae235&#x2F;15747_A1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.screwfix.com&#x2F;is&#x2F;image&#x2F;ae235&#x2F;15747_A1</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;JCNm9CX.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;JCNm9CX.png</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41538754&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341538754\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                        <tr class='athing comtr' id='41536053'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='4'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"160\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41536053' href='vote?id=41536053&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=giobox\" class=\"hnuser\">giobox</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-13T23:15:55.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41536053\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41536053\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533647\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41534436\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41534531\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41534481\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41536053\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">As far as i&#x27;m aware, often times they just plug into an open socket on an existing powerstrip that are so often used for PCs, no vampire-ing required. You can then unplug the powerstrip from the wall, it stays powered, inputing electricity through one of the sockets instead of drawing.<p>I guess a more elaborate version of the same idea can be done if the computer plugged directly to an outlet with two sockets too, removing the socket from the wall.<p>The only time I can forsee vampiring the cable being a thing would be if computer is directly plugged into a single socket outlet on the wall?<p>&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;erq4TO_a3z8?si=jzOqrzyu7LZLfJIm&amp;t=135\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;erq4TO_a3z8?si=jzOqrzyu7LZLfJIm&amp;t=135</a><p>&gt; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiebetech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;hotplug-field-kit&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiebetech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;hotplug-field-kit&#x2F;</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41536053&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341536053\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                                    <tr class='athing comtr' id='41534481'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='0'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41534481' href='vote?id=41534481&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=theideaofcoffee\" class=\"hnuser\">theideaofcoffee</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-13T19:44:33.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41534481\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41534481\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533647\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41538140\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41534481\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">This is a great writeup! Especially for those that may want to DIY it, the how and the why and all of that, and not have to shell out for carrier-quality Layer 1 encryption devices. Nice to see that even off-the-shelf components can do it with relative ease at those rates. Also nice to see sane sysctl tunes as well. Anything to make an adversary&#x27;s day a bit harder.

Otherwise, the CPUs&#x2F;platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely.

Then again, Wireguard is definitely still a good tool for stuff like this, and maybe the performance penalty isn&#x27;t a big deal here.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41533955&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341533955\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41536469'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41536469' href='vote?id=41536469&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=alphager\" class=\"hnuser\">alphager</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T00:22:41.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41536469\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41536469\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533955\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41534504\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41536469\" n=\"5\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">AES can only encrypt up to 64TB; after that you need to re-key.

XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that&#x27;s not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it&#x27;s not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways.<p>Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you&#x27;re implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard&#x27;s crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I&#x27;m not sure AES-GCM wouldn&#x27;t have been the best (albeit less cool) choice.<p>Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I&#x27;d bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41539518&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699%2341539518\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41540673'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='6'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"240\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41540673' href='vote?id=41540673&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531699'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=tptacek\" class=\"hnuser\">tptacek</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T16:01:18.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41540673\">8 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41540673\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533955\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41539518\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41535779\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41540673\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">WireGuard is an instantiation of Noise, which slightly disfavors AES-GCM (see: the spec).

It would clamp around a power cable and inject a UPS in the mix so that an electronic device could be removed without turning it off. Seemed like a useful little trick.    reply            0cf8612b2e1e  1 day ago    | parent | next  [–]      If nothing else, would let you move a Frogger machine. More seriously, I have wondered if you can detect these kinds of external interference. Auto lock the machine if power/network/wifi/Bluetooth/USB conditions change. Nabbing an unlocked laptop was how they got the Silk Road guy (though they probably already had sufficient evidence elsewhere). https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/sunk-how-ross-ul...    reply            jeroenhd  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      One trick you could use is to abuse the fact that law enforcement often plugs in a mouse wiggler on an unlocked desktop and kill your server the moment you see a new HID device (make sure to run some kind of desktop on your server so they think they can keep the session open, best to do it in a VM). You could also monitor the ethernet link. They can move your server but they can't move the entire network, set up an encrypted tunnel between two distant physical servers and self destruct the moment that tunnel gets disrupted. Some computers come with gyros/accelerometers built in. My old HP laptop had some kind of head crash prevention that used that hardware. I know this, because Gnome thought it was a tablet style sensor and turned my screen upside down if I didn't disable the sensor. Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors. You could probably figure out if the server is being moved by measuring capacitance of the case, measuring accelerometers, maybe add a GPS dongle. Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room. You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn't get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages. Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn't that hard with opencv if you're dedicated enough. You have to hide your security measures and never tell anyone, though, or they'll just leave the server as-is and use the classic rubber hose exploit to make you give up the key material.    reply            tbrownaw  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      > Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room. Incoming Bluetooth Low Energy announcements should have a receive power level associated with them. Stick a beacon (like say a standard ble temperature/humidity sensor) somewhere, and you should be able to tell if the distance to it changes.    reply            gosub100  22 hours ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      https://github.com/defuse/swatd    reply            Onavo  23 hours ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      All these suggestions are so unreliable. What happened to HN? This is 2024, have some creativity. Feed all the surrounding cameras and mics into a massive neural network and you have a more robust solution than anything else. Just make sure you don't cosplay (or roleplay too much during sex) as a hobby.

Or spend a little bit more money to add a gyro and make a real, if very low accuracy, IMU.    reply            0cf8612b2e1e  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      That is a great suggestion. I think Android just implemented a “snatch detection” system for phones. Although, I like the idea of not requiring additional hardware.

You just need to plug into the other plug. * In case they are split for whatever reason (switched plug, different circuit) whatever, just take off the faceplate, pull out the outlet, and now you have direct access to the screw terminals and copper wiring on the outlet. You could wire into the plug using the second set of terminals or via the other connection method (one being the screw terminals, the other being the \"insert into the hole\" depending on which is used) and take the whole outlet with you.    reply            aaronmdjones  14 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      That would apply in North America yeah; that wouldn't apply over here (UK). The insulation on plug pins prevents you pulling the plug far enough out of the socket to use a plug pin capture device; if it's far enough out of the socket to expose the uninsulated portion of the pins, it is no longer far enough into the socket to be receiving voltage, and you've just interrupted the power, which is precisely what you don't want. The design of our wall sockets is such that there is no separate faceplate assembly; you'd have to take the entire socket off of the wall. Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power. Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can't know that the ring is no longer complete. In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you'd first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety. [2] I dare say this is more involved and riskier than simply carefully cutting into the equipment power cord. Also, good luck finding enough slack conductor behind a wall socket in order to pull this off.

I guess a more elaborate version of the same idea can be done if the computer plugged directly to an outlet with two sockets too, removing the socket from the wall.

My solution ended up using tc's mirred[0] action for implementing a fully L2-transparent frame relay. I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that's just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge. I spent close to a week optimizing my setup looking at kernel flame graphs and perf results, reading adapter-specific tuning guides and driver source, and can say that the only really meaningful performance optimizations (in both the Broadwell- and Zen3/Vermeer-based implementations I tried) were disabling mitigations in the kernel (esp. on Zen3, that boosted performance by more than 20%), and getting CPU frequency scaling/idle states sorted out correctly (which yielded much higher wins on the older Broadwell uarch, because power state transition appears to happen much quicker on Zen3). As for the solution presented in the (on the whole really great; I love it!) article, I have my doubts about the effectiveness of the cargo-culted  \"sysctl tuning\" mentioned - TCP, for example, is simply not involved at all in the described setup, so \"tuning\" its buffer allocations cannot have any effect on the workload.

Otherwise, the CPUs/platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely. One can tweak things to reach a sweet spot in the middle, where you can achieve ~99% of the peak performance at very sensible idle power draw (i.e., ~25W when the link isn't loaded). With Zen3, this hardly mattered at all. I also got to witness that using IPv4 for the wireguard \"overlay\" network yielded about 30% better performance than when using IPv6 with ULA prefixes.

That CPU supports AES-NI and probably does it a lot faster than Wireguard's ChaCha20 (hard to get numbers for their server CPU, but the tiny little x86 mini PC I use as my router does AES XTS at 43Gbps according to `cryptsetup benchmark`). You might see better performance by tunneling the vxlan connection using a different technology which can use AES-NI?

AES is fine. It's possible that, if Jason had the decisions to do over again today, he might use XAES instead of ChaPoly (he didn't have an especially good AES construction to use at the time). The big thing with WireGuard is not doing ciphersuite negotiation, which is an extremely good decision that is definitely worth paying some cycles/byte for (if you must).    reply            rainsford  11 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Maybe I'm missing something, but why would he have needed XAES rather than vanilla AES-GCM, which was certainly available at the time WireGuard was created?  XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that's not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it's not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways. Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you're implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard's crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I'm not sure AES-GCM wouldn't have been the best (albeit less cool) choice. Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I'd bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.    reply            tptacek  8 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      WireGuard is an instantiation of Noise, which slightly disfavors AES-GCM (see: the spec).

You could also monitor the ethernet link. They can move your server but they can't move the entire network, set up an encrypted tunnel between two distant physical servers and self destruct the moment that tunnel gets disrupted. Some computers come with gyros/accelerometers built in. My old HP laptop had some kind of head crash prevention that used that hardware. I know this, because Gnome thought it was a tablet style sensor and turned my screen upside down if I didn't disable the sensor. Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors. You could probably figure out if the server is being moved by measuring capacitance of the case, measuring accelerometers, maybe add a GPS dongle. Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room. You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn't get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages. Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn't that hard with opencv if you're dedicated enough. You have to hide your security measures and never tell anyone, though, or they'll just leave the server as-is and use the classic rubber hose exploit to make you give up the key material.    reply            tbrownaw  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      > Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room.

Edit: If the machine is plugged into a power bar / power strip / whatever you want to call it, this is much easier still: Plug the vampire UPS into the power bar as well, wait for it to sync up to the grid, and disconnect the bar from the outlet. The UPS continues to feed power into the bar and thus keeps the machine powered.    reply            pests  18 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Power strips make this easier of course, but every outlet usually has two plugs and most* of the time they are wired together. You just need to plug into the other plug. * In case they are split for whatever reason (switched plug, different circuit) whatever, just take off the faceplate, pull out the outlet, and now you have direct access to the screw terminals and copper wiring on the outlet. You could wire into the plug using the second set of terminals or via the other connection method (one being the screw terminals, the other being the \"insert into the hole\" depending on which is used) and take the whole outlet with you.    reply            aaronmdjones  14 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      That would apply in North America yeah; that wouldn't apply over here (UK). The insulation on plug pins prevents you pulling the plug far enough out of the socket to use a plug pin capture device; if it's far enough out of the socket to expose the uninsulated portion of the pins, it is no longer far enough into the socket to be receiving voltage, and you've just interrupted the power, which is precisely what you don't want. The design of our wall sockets is such that there is no separate faceplate assembly; you'd have to take the entire socket off of the wall. Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power. Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can't know that the ring is no longer complete. In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you'd first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety. [2] I dare say this is more involved and riskier than simply carefully cutting into the equipment power cord. Also, good luck finding enough slack conductor behind a wall socket in order to pull this off.

You can then unplug the powerstrip from the wall, it stays powered, inputing electricity through one of the sockets instead of drawing. I guess a more elaborate version of the same idea can be done if the computer plugged directly to an outlet with two sockets too, removing the socket from the wall. The only time I can forsee vampiring the cable being a thing would be if computer is directly plugged into a single socket outlet on the wall? > https://youtu.be/erq4TO_a3z8?si=jzOqrzyu7LZLfJIm&t=135 > https://wiebetech.com/products/hotplug-field-kit/    reply            theideaofcoffee  1 day ago    | prev | next  [–]      This is a great writeup!

My solution ended up using tc's mirred[0] action for implementing a fully L2-transparent frame relay. I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that's just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge. I spent close to a week optimizing my setup looking at kernel flame graphs and perf results, reading adapter-specific tuning guides and driver source, and can say that the only really meaningful performance optimizations (in both the Broadwell- and Zen3/Vermeer-based implementations I tried) were disabling mitigations in the kernel (esp. on Zen3, that boosted performance by more than 20%), and getting CPU frequency scaling/idle states sorted out correctly (which yielded much higher wins on the older Broadwell uarch, because power state transition appears to happen much quicker on Zen3). As for the solution presented in the (on the whole really great; I love it!) article, I have my doubts about the effectiveness of the cargo-culted  \"sysctl tuning\" mentioned - TCP, for example, is simply not involved at all in the described setup, so \"tuning\" its buffer allocations cannot have any effect on the workload.

Otherwise, the CPUs/platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely. One can tweak things to reach a sweet spot in the middle, where you can achieve ~99% of the peak performance at very sensible idle power draw (i.e., ~25W when the link isn't loaded). With Zen3, this hardly mattered at all. I also got to witness that using IPv4 for the wireguard \"overlay\" network yielded about 30% better performance than when using IPv6 with ULA prefixes.

That CPU supports AES-NI and probably does it a lot faster than Wireguard's ChaCha20 (hard to get numbers for their server CPU, but the tiny little x86 mini PC I use as my router does AES XTS at 43Gbps according to `cryptsetup benchmark`). You might see better performance by tunneling the vxlan connection using a different technology which can use AES-NI?

Not trying to be argumentative, genuinely curious.

AES is fine. It's possible that, if Jason had the decisions to do over again today, he might use XAES instead of ChaPoly (he didn't have an especially good AES construction to use at the time). The big thing with WireGuard is not doing ciphersuite negotiation, which is an extremely good decision that is definitely worth paying some cycles/byte for (if you must).    reply            rainsford  11 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Maybe I'm missing something, but why would he have needed XAES rather than vanilla AES-GCM, which was certainly available at the time WireGuard was created?  XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that's not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it's not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways. Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you're implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard's crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I'm not sure AES-GCM wouldn't have been the best (albeit less cool) choice. Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I'd bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.    reply            tptacek  8 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      WireGuard is an instantiation of Noise, which slightly disfavors AES-GCM (see: the spec).

You could also monitor the ethernet link. They can move your server but they can't move the entire network, set up an encrypted tunnel between two distant physical servers and self destruct the moment that tunnel gets disrupted. Some computers come with gyros/accelerometers built in. My old HP laptop had some kind of head crash prevention that used that hardware. I know this, because Gnome thought it was a tablet style sensor and turned my screen upside down if I didn't disable the sensor. Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors. You could probably figure out if the server is being moved by measuring capacitance of the case, measuring accelerometers, maybe add a GPS dongle. Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room. You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn't get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages. Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn't that hard with opencv if you're dedicated enough. You have to hide your security measures and never tell anyone, though, or they'll just leave the server as-is and use the classic rubber hose exploit to make you give up the key material.    reply            tbrownaw  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      > Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room.

You just need to plug into the other plug. * In case they are split for whatever reason (switched plug, different circuit) whatever, just take off the faceplate, pull out the outlet, and now you have direct access to the screw terminals and copper wiring on the outlet. You could wire into the plug using the second set of terminals or via the other connection method (one being the screw terminals, the other being the \"insert into the hole\" depending on which is used) and take the whole outlet with you.    reply            aaronmdjones  14 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      That would apply in North America yeah; that wouldn't apply over here (UK). The insulation on plug pins prevents you pulling the plug far enough out of the socket to use a plug pin capture device; if it's far enough out of the socket to expose the uninsulated portion of the pins, it is no longer far enough into the socket to be receiving voltage, and you've just interrupted the power, which is precisely what you don't want. The design of our wall sockets is such that there is no separate faceplate assembly; you'd have to take the entire socket off of the wall. Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power. Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can't know that the ring is no longer complete. In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you'd first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety. [2] I dare say this is more involved and riskier than simply carefully cutting into the equipment power cord. Also, good luck finding enough slack conductor behind a wall socket in order to pull this off.

You can then unplug the powerstrip from the wall, it stays powered, inputing electricity through one of the sockets instead of drawing. I guess a more elaborate version of the same idea can be done if the computer plugged directly to an outlet with two sockets too, removing the socket from the wall. The only time I can forsee vampiring the cable being a thing would be if computer is directly plugged into a single socket outlet on the wall? > https://youtu.be/erq4TO_a3z8?si=jzOqrzyu7LZLfJIm&t=135 > https://wiebetech.com/products/hotplug-field-kit/    reply            theideaofcoffee  1 day ago    | prev | next  [–]      This is a great writeup!

I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that's just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge. I spent close to a week optimizing my setup looking at kernel flame graphs and perf results, reading adapter-specific tuning guides and driver source, and can say that the only really meaningful performance optimizations (in both the Broadwell- and Zen3/Vermeer-based implementations I tried) were disabling mitigations in the kernel (esp. on Zen3, that boosted performance by more than 20%), and getting CPU frequency scaling/idle states sorted out correctly (which yielded much higher wins on the older Broadwell uarch, because power state transition appears to happen much quicker on Zen3). As for the solution presented in the (on the whole really great; I love it!) article, I have my doubts about the effectiveness of the cargo-culted  \"sysctl tuning\" mentioned - TCP, for example, is simply not involved at all in the described setup, so \"tuning\" its buffer allocations cannot have any effect on the workload.

Otherwise, the CPUs/platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely. One can tweak things to reach a sweet spot in the middle, where you can achieve ~99% of the peak performance at very sensible idle power draw (i.e., ~25W when the link isn't loaded). With Zen3, this hardly mattered at all. I also got to witness that using IPv4 for the wireguard \"overlay\" network yielded about 30% better performance than when using IPv6 with ULA prefixes.

FWIW, the reason I brought up performance was because the OP spends a large chunk of the post talking about it, so I assume it's an important requirement for them.    reply            tptacek  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      It's not about AES, it's about the WireGuard protocol. AES is fine. It's possible that, if Jason had the decisions to do over again today, he might use XAES instead of ChaPoly (he didn't have an especially good AES construction to use at the time). The big thing with WireGuard is not doing ciphersuite negotiation, which is an extremely good decision that is definitely worth paying some cycles/byte for (if you must).    reply            rainsford  11 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Maybe I'm missing something, but why would he have needed XAES rather than vanilla AES-GCM, which was certainly available at the time WireGuard was created?  XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that's not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it's not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways. Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you're implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard's crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I'm not sure AES-GCM wouldn't have been the best (albeit less cool) choice. Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I'd bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.    reply            tptacek  8 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      WireGuard is an instantiation of Noise, which slightly disfavors AES-GCM (see: the spec). I don't think it's a huge big deal, but at the time WireGuard was being designed it was pretty normal to tack away from GCM. I agree in advance, Noise already uses counter-based nonces, the extended nonce wouldn't matter to vanilla Noise.    reply            wmf  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      AES is probably fine as a cipher but the VPN protocols that aren't Wireguard tend to have various footguns available.

You could also monitor the ethernet link. They can move your server but they can't move the entire network, set up an encrypted tunnel between two distant physical servers and self destruct the moment that tunnel gets disrupted. Some computers come with gyros/accelerometers built in. My old HP laptop had some kind of head crash prevention that used that hardware. I know this, because Gnome thought it was a tablet style sensor and turned my screen upside down if I didn't disable the sensor. Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors. You could probably figure out if the server is being moved by measuring capacitance of the case, measuring accelerometers, maybe add a GPS dongle. Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room. You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn't get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages. Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn't that hard with opencv if you're dedicated enough. You have to hide your security measures and never tell anyone, though, or they'll just leave the server as-is and use the classic rubber hose exploit to make you give up the key material.    reply            tbrownaw  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      > Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room.

The insulation on plug pins prevents you pulling the plug far enough out of the socket to use a plug pin capture device; if it's far enough out of the socket to expose the uninsulated portion of the pins, it is no longer far enough into the socket to be receiving voltage, and you've just interrupted the power, which is precisely what you don't want. The design of our wall sockets is such that there is no separate faceplate assembly; you'd have to take the entire socket off of the wall. Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power. Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can't know that the ring is no longer complete. In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you'd first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety. [2] I dare say this is more involved and riskier than simply carefully cutting into the equipment power cord. Also, good luck finding enough slack conductor behind a wall socket in order to pull this off.

I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that's just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge. I spent close to a week optimizing my setup looking at kernel flame graphs and perf results, reading adapter-specific tuning guides and driver source, and can say that the only really meaningful performance optimizations (in both the Broadwell- and Zen3/Vermeer-based implementations I tried) were disabling mitigations in the kernel (esp. on Zen3, that boosted performance by more than 20%), and getting CPU frequency scaling/idle states sorted out correctly (which yielded much higher wins on the older Broadwell uarch, because power state transition appears to happen much quicker on Zen3). As for the solution presented in the (on the whole really great; I love it!) article, I have my doubts about the effectiveness of the cargo-culted  \"sysctl tuning\" mentioned - TCP, for example, is simply not involved at all in the described setup, so \"tuning\" its buffer allocations cannot have any effect on the workload.

Otherwise, the CPUs/platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely. One can tweak things to reach a sweet spot in the middle, where you can achieve ~99% of the peak performance at very sensible idle power draw (i.e., ~25W when the link isn't loaded). With Zen3, this hardly mattered at all. I also got to witness that using IPv4 for the wireguard \"overlay\" network yielded about 30% better performance than when using IPv6 with ULA prefixes.

Just spit-balling a little, but I wonder if Wireguard is the best tool here given that the author is only using it for a single point-to-point link and they control the devices on both ends. That CPU supports AES-NI and probably does it a lot faster than Wireguard's ChaCha20 (hard to get numbers for their server CPU, but the tiny little x86 mini PC I use as my router does AES XTS at 43Gbps according to `cryptsetup benchmark`). You might see better performance by tunneling the vxlan connection using a different technology which can use AES-NI? Then again, Wireguard is definitely still a good tool for stuff like this, and maybe the performance penalty isn't a big deal here.    reply            alphager  1 day ago    | parent | next  [–]      AES can only encrypt up to 64TB; after that you need to re-key.

Not trying to be argumentative, genuinely curious. My understanding is that AES has some design warts that make it not ideal (basically, it's easy to both implement and use in ways that leak information if you're not careful) but that it's still essentially perfect symmetric encryption if you're using it as recommended. Is that wrong? FWIW, the reason I brought up performance was because the OP spends a large chunk of the post talking about it, so I assume it's an important requirement for them.    reply            tptacek  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      It's not about AES, it's about the WireGuard protocol. AES is fine. It's possible that, if Jason had the decisions to do over again today, he might use XAES instead of ChaPoly (he didn't have an especially good AES construction to use at the time). The big thing with WireGuard is not doing ciphersuite negotiation, which is an extremely good decision that is definitely worth paying some cycles/byte for (if you must).    reply            rainsford  11 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Maybe I'm missing something, but why would he have needed XAES rather than vanilla AES-GCM, which was certainly available at the time WireGuard was created?  XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that's not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it's not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways. Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you're implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard's crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I'm not sure AES-GCM wouldn't have been the best (albeit less cool) choice. Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I'd bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.    reply            tptacek  8 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      WireGuard is an instantiation of Noise, which slightly disfavors AES-GCM (see: the spec). I don't think it's a huge big deal, but at the time WireGuard was being designed it was pretty normal to tack away from GCM. I agree in advance, Noise already uses counter-based nonces, the extended nonce wouldn't matter to vanilla Noise.    reply            wmf  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      AES is probably fine as a cipher but the VPN protocols that aren't Wireguard tend to have various footguns available.

You could also monitor the ethernet link. They can move your server but they can't move the entire network, set up an encrypted tunnel between two distant physical servers and self destruct the moment that tunnel gets disrupted.

I know this, because Gnome thought it was a tablet style sensor and turned my screen upside down if I didn't disable the sensor. Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors. You could probably figure out if the server is being moved by measuring capacitance of the case, measuring accelerometers, maybe add a GPS dongle. Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room. You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn't get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages. Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn't that hard with opencv if you're dedicated enough. You have to hide your security measures and never tell anyone, though, or they'll just leave the server as-is and use the classic rubber hose exploit to make you give up the key material.    reply            tbrownaw  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      > Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room.

The insulation on plug pins prevents you pulling the plug far enough out of the socket to use a plug pin capture device; if it's far enough out of the socket to expose the uninsulated portion of the pins, it is no longer far enough into the socket to be receiving voltage, and you've just interrupted the power, which is precisely what you don't want. The design of our wall sockets is such that there is no separate faceplate assembly; you'd have to take the entire socket off of the wall. Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power. Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can't know that the ring is no longer complete. In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you'd first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety.

You can then unplug the powerstrip from the wall, it stays powered, inputing electricity through one of the sockets instead of drawing. I guess a more elaborate version of the same idea can be done if the computer plugged directly to an outlet with two sockets too, removing the socket from the wall.

My solution ended up using tc's mirred[0] action for implementing a fully L2-transparent frame relay. I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that's just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge. I spent close to a week optimizing my setup looking at kernel flame graphs and perf results, reading adapter-specific tuning guides and driver source, and can say that the only really meaningful performance optimizations (in both the Broadwell- and Zen3/Vermeer-based implementations I tried) were disabling mitigations in the kernel (esp. on Zen3, that boosted performance by more than 20%), and getting CPU frequency scaling/idle states sorted out correctly (which yielded much higher wins on the older Broadwell uarch, because power state transition appears to happen much quicker on Zen3). As for the solution presented in the (on the whole really great; I love it!) article, I have my doubts about the effectiveness of the cargo-culted  \"sysctl tuning\" mentioned - TCP, for example, is simply not involved at all in the described setup, so \"tuning\" its buffer allocations cannot have any effect on the workload.

Otherwise, the CPUs/platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely. One can tweak things to reach a sweet spot in the middle, where you can achieve ~99% of the peak performance at very sensible idle power draw (i.e., ~25W when the link isn't loaded). With Zen3, this hardly mattered at all. I also got to witness that using IPv4 for the wireguard \"overlay\" network yielded about 30% better performance than when using IPv6 with ULA prefixes.

Just spit-balling a little, but I wonder if Wireguard is the best tool here given that the author is only using it for a single point-to-point link and they control the devices on both ends. That CPU supports AES-NI and probably does it a lot faster than Wireguard's ChaCha20 (hard to get numbers for their server CPU, but the tiny little x86 mini PC I use as my router does AES XTS at 43Gbps according to `cryptsetup benchmark`). You might see better performance by tunneling the vxlan connection using a different technology which can use AES-NI? Then again, Wireguard is definitely still a good tool for stuff like this, and maybe the performance penalty isn't a big deal here.    reply            alphager  1 day ago    | parent | next  [–]      AES can only encrypt up to 64TB; after that you need to re-key.

Not trying to be argumentative, genuinely curious. My understanding is that AES has some design warts that make it not ideal (basically, it's easy to both implement and use in ways that leak information if you're not careful) but that it's still essentially perfect symmetric encryption if you're using it as recommended. Is that wrong? FWIW, the reason I brought up performance was because the OP spends a large chunk of the post talking about it, so I assume it's an important requirement for them.    reply            tptacek  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      It's not about AES, it's about the WireGuard protocol. AES is fine. It's possible that, if Jason had the decisions to do over again today, he might use XAES instead of ChaPoly (he didn't have an especially good AES construction to use at the time). The big thing with WireGuard is not doing ciphersuite negotiation, which is an extremely good decision that is definitely worth paying some cycles/byte for (if you must).    reply            rainsford  11 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Maybe I'm missing something, but why would he have needed XAES rather than vanilla AES-GCM, which was certainly available at the time WireGuard was created?  XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that's not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it's not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways. Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you're implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard's crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I'm not sure AES-GCM wouldn't have been the best (albeit less cool) choice. Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I'd bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.    reply            tptacek  8 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      WireGuard is an instantiation of Noise, which slightly disfavors AES-GCM (see: the spec). I don't think it's a huge big deal, but at the time WireGuard was being designed it was pretty normal to tack away from GCM. I agree in advance, Noise already uses counter-based nonces, the extended nonce wouldn't matter to vanilla Noise.    reply            wmf  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      AES is probably fine as a cipher but the VPN protocols that aren't Wireguard tend to have various footguns available.

You could also monitor the ethernet link.

I know this, because Gnome thought it was a tablet style sensor and turned my screen upside down if I didn't disable the sensor. Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors. You could probably figure out if the server is being moved by measuring capacitance of the case, measuring accelerometers, maybe add a GPS dongle. Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room. You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn't get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages. Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn't that hard with opencv if you're dedicated enough.

You just need to plug into the other plug. * In case they are split for whatever reason (switched plug, different circuit) whatever, just take off the faceplate, pull out the outlet, and now you have direct access to the screw terminals and copper wiring on the outlet. You could wire into the plug using the second set of terminals or via the other connection method (one being the screw terminals, the other being the \"insert into the hole\" depending on which is used) and take the whole outlet with you.    reply            aaronmdjones  14 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      That would apply in North America yeah; that wouldn't apply over here (UK). The insulation on plug pins prevents you pulling the plug far enough out of the socket to use a plug pin capture device; if it's far enough out of the socket to expose the uninsulated portion of the pins, it is no longer far enough into the socket to be receiving voltage, and you've just interrupted the power, which is precisely what you don't want. The design of our wall sockets is such that there is no separate faceplate assembly; you'd have to take the entire socket off of the wall. Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power. Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can't know that the ring is no longer complete. In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you'd first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety. [2] I dare say this is more involved and riskier than simply carefully cutting into the equipment power cord. Also, good luck finding enough slack conductor behind a wall socket in order to pull this off.

You can then unplug the powerstrip from the wall, it stays powered, inputing electricity through one of the sockets instead of drawing. I guess a more elaborate version of the same idea can be done if the computer plugged directly to an outlet with two sockets too, removing the socket from the wall.

My solution ended up using tc's mirred[0] action for implementing a fully L2-transparent frame relay. I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that's just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge. I spent close to a week optimizing my setup looking at kernel flame graphs and perf results, reading adapter-specific tuning guides and driver source, and can say that the only really meaningful performance optimizations (in both the Broadwell- and Zen3/Vermeer-based implementations I tried) were disabling mitigations in the kernel (esp. on Zen3, that boosted performance by more than 20%), and getting CPU frequency scaling/idle states sorted out correctly (which yielded much higher wins on the older Broadwell uarch, because power state transition appears to happen much quicker on Zen3). As for the solution presented in the (on the whole really great; I love it!) article, I have my doubts about the effectiveness of the cargo-culted  \"sysctl tuning\" mentioned - TCP, for example, is simply not involved at all in the described setup, so \"tuning\" its buffer allocations cannot have any effect on the workload.

Otherwise, the CPUs/platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely. One can tweak things to reach a sweet spot in the middle, where you can achieve ~99% of the peak performance at very sensible idle power draw (i.e., ~25W when the link isn't loaded). With Zen3, this hardly mattered at all. I also got to witness that using IPv4 for the wireguard \"overlay\" network yielded about 30% better performance than when using IPv6 with ULA prefixes.

Just spit-balling a little, but I wonder if Wireguard is the best tool here given that the author is only using it for a single point-to-point link and they control the devices on both ends. That CPU supports AES-NI and probably does it a lot faster than Wireguard's ChaCha20 (hard to get numbers for their server CPU, but the tiny little x86 mini PC I use as my router does AES XTS at 43Gbps according to `cryptsetup benchmark`). You might see better performance by tunneling the vxlan connection using a different technology which can use AES-NI?

Not trying to be argumentative, genuinely curious.

AES is fine. It's possible that, if Jason had the decisions to do over again today, he might use XAES instead of ChaPoly (he didn't have an especially good AES construction to use at the time). The big thing with WireGuard is not doing ciphersuite negotiation, which is an extremely good decision that is definitely worth paying some cycles/byte for (if you must).    reply            rainsford  11 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Maybe I'm missing something, but why would he have needed XAES rather than vanilla AES-GCM, which was certainly available at the time WireGuard was created?  XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that's not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it's not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways. Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you're implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard's crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I'm not sure AES-GCM wouldn't have been the best (albeit less cool) choice. Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I'd bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.    reply            tptacek  8 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      WireGuard is an instantiation of Noise, which slightly disfavors AES-GCM (see: the spec). I don't think it's a huge big deal, but at the time WireGuard was being designed it was pretty normal to tack away from GCM.

Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors.

You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn't get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages. Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn't that hard with opencv if you're dedicated enough.

You just need to plug into the other plug. * In case they are split for whatever reason (switched plug, different circuit) whatever, just take off the faceplate, pull out the outlet, and now you have direct access to the screw terminals and copper wiring on the outlet. You could wire into the plug using the second set of terminals or via the other connection method (one being the screw terminals, the other being the \"insert into the hole\" depending on which is used) and take the whole outlet with you.    reply            aaronmdjones  14 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      That would apply in North America yeah; that wouldn't apply over here (UK). The insulation on plug pins prevents you pulling the plug far enough out of the socket to use a plug pin capture device; if it's far enough out of the socket to expose the uninsulated portion of the pins, it is no longer far enough into the socket to be receiving voltage, and you've just interrupted the power, which is precisely what you don't want. The design of our wall sockets is such that there is no separate faceplate assembly; you'd have to take the entire socket off of the wall. Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power. Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can't know that the ring is no longer complete. In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you'd first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety. [2] I dare say this is more involved and riskier than simply carefully cutting into the equipment power cord. Also, good luck finding enough slack conductor behind a wall socket in order to pull this off.

I guess a more elaborate version of the same idea can be done if the computer plugged directly to an outlet with two sockets too, removing the socket from the wall.

I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that's just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge. I spent close to a week optimizing my setup looking at kernel flame graphs and perf results, reading adapter-specific tuning guides and driver source, and can say that the only really meaningful performance optimizations (in both the Broadwell- and Zen3/Vermeer-based implementations I tried) were disabling mitigations in the kernel (esp. on Zen3, that boosted performance by more than 20%), and getting CPU frequency scaling/idle states sorted out correctly (which yielded much higher wins on the older Broadwell uarch, because power state transition appears to happen much quicker on Zen3). As for the solution presented in the (on the whole really great; I love it!) article, I have my doubts about the effectiveness of the cargo-culted  \"sysctl tuning\" mentioned - TCP, for example, is simply not involved at all in the described setup, so \"tuning\" its buffer allocations cannot have any effect on the workload.

Otherwise, the CPUs/platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely. One can tweak things to reach a sweet spot in the middle, where you can achieve ~99% of the peak performance at very sensible idle power draw (i.e., ~25W when the link isn't loaded). With Zen3, this hardly mattered at all. I also got to witness that using IPv4 for the wireguard \"overlay\" network yielded about 30% better performance than when using IPv6 with ULA prefixes.

You might see better performance by tunneling the vxlan connection using a different technology which can use AES-NI?

AES is fine. It's possible that, if Jason had the decisions to do over again today, he might use XAES instead of ChaPoly (he didn't have an especially good AES construction to use at the time). The big thing with WireGuard is not doing ciphersuite negotiation, which is an extremely good decision that is definitely worth paying some cycles/byte for (if you must).    reply            rainsford  11 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Maybe I'm missing something, but why would he have needed XAES rather than vanilla AES-GCM, which was certainly available at the time WireGuard was created?  XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that's not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it's not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways. Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you're implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard's crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I'm not sure AES-GCM wouldn't have been the best (albeit less cool) choice. Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I'd bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.    reply            tptacek  8 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      WireGuard is an instantiation of Noise, which slightly disfavors AES-GCM (see: the spec).

You could also monitor the ethernet link. They can move your server but they can't move the entire network, set up an encrypted tunnel between two distant physical servers and self destruct the moment that tunnel gets disrupted. Some computers come with gyros/accelerometers built in. My old HP laptop had some kind of head crash prevention that used that hardware. I know this, because Gnome thought it was a tablet style sensor and turned my screen upside down if I didn't disable the sensor. Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors. You could probably figure out if the server is being moved by measuring capacitance of the case, measuring accelerometers, maybe add a GPS dongle. Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room. You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn't get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages. Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn't that hard with opencv if you're dedicated enough. You have to hide your security measures and never tell anyone, though, or they'll just leave the server as-is and use the classic rubber hose exploit to make you give up the key material.    reply            tbrownaw  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      > Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room.

You just need to plug into the other plug. * In case they are split for whatever reason (switched plug, different circuit) whatever, just take off the faceplate, pull out the outlet, and now you have direct access to the screw terminals and copper wiring on the outlet. You could wire into the plug using the second set of terminals or via the other connection method (one being the screw terminals, the other being the \"insert into the hole\" depending on which is used) and take the whole outlet with you.    reply            aaronmdjones  14 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      That would apply in North America yeah; that wouldn't apply over here (UK). The insulation on plug pins prevents you pulling the plug far enough out of the socket to use a plug pin capture device; if it's far enough out of the socket to expose the uninsulated portion of the pins, it is no longer far enough into the socket to be receiving voltage, and you've just interrupted the power, which is precisely what you don't want. The design of our wall sockets is such that there is no separate faceplate assembly; you'd have to take the entire socket off of the wall. Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power. Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can't know that the ring is no longer complete. In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you'd first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety. [2] I dare say this is more involved and riskier than simply carefully cutting into the equipment power cord. Also, good luck finding enough slack conductor behind a wall socket in order to pull this off.

You can then unplug the powerstrip from the wall, it stays powered, inputing electricity through one of the sockets instead of drawing. I guess a more elaborate version of the same idea can be done if the computer plugged directly to an outlet with two sockets too, removing the socket from the wall. The only time I can forsee vampiring the cable being a thing would be if computer is directly plugged into a single socket outlet on the wall? > https://youtu.be/erq4TO_a3z8?si=jzOqrzyu7LZLfJIm&t=135 > https://wiebetech.com/products/hotplug-field-kit/    reply            theideaofcoffee  1 day ago    | prev | next  [–]      This is a great writeup!

I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that's just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge. I spent close to a week optimizing my setup looking at kernel flame graphs and perf results, reading adapter-specific tuning guides and driver source, and can say that the only really meaningful performance optimizations (in both the Broadwell- and Zen3/Vermeer-based implementations I tried) were disabling mitigations in the kernel (esp. on Zen3, that boosted performance by more than 20%), and getting CPU frequency scaling/idle states sorted out correctly (which yielded much higher wins on the older Broadwell uarch, because power state transition appears to happen much quicker on Zen3). As for the solution presented in the (on the whole really great; I love it!) article, I have my doubts about the effectiveness of the cargo-culted  \"sysctl tuning\" mentioned - TCP, for example, is simply not involved at all in the described setup, so \"tuning\" its buffer allocations cannot have any effect on the workload.

Otherwise, the CPUs/platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely. One can tweak things to reach a sweet spot in the middle, where you can achieve ~99% of the peak performance at very sensible idle power draw (i.e., ~25W when the link isn't loaded). With Zen3, this hardly mattered at all. I also got to witness that using IPv4 for the wireguard \"overlay\" network yielded about 30% better performance than when using IPv6 with ULA prefixes.

You might see better performance by tunneling the vxlan connection using a different technology which can use AES-NI?

AES is fine. It's possible that, if Jason had the decisions to do over again today, he might use XAES instead of ChaPoly (he didn't have an especially good AES construction to use at the time). The big thing with WireGuard is not doing ciphersuite negotiation, which is an extremely good decision that is definitely worth paying some cycles/byte for (if you must).    reply            rainsford  11 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Maybe I'm missing something, but why would he have needed XAES rather than vanilla AES-GCM, which was certainly available at the time WireGuard was created?  XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that's not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it's not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways. Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you're implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard's crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I'm not sure AES-GCM wouldn't have been the best (albeit less cool) choice. Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I'd bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.    reply            tptacek  8 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      WireGuard is an instantiation of Noise, which slightly disfavors AES-GCM (see: the spec). I don't think it's a huge big deal, but at the time WireGuard was being designed it was pretty normal to tack away from GCM. I agree in advance, Noise already uses counter-based nonces, the extended nonce wouldn't matter to vanilla Noise.    reply            wmf  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      AES is probably fine as a cipher but the VPN protocols that aren't Wireguard tend to have various footguns available.

You could also monitor the ethernet link.

I know this, because Gnome thought it was a tablet style sensor and turned my screen upside down if I didn't disable the sensor. Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors. You could probably figure out if the server is being moved by measuring capacitance of the case, measuring accelerometers, maybe add a GPS dongle. Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room. You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn't get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages. Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn't that hard with opencv if you're dedicated enough.

The insulation on plug pins prevents you pulling the plug far enough out of the socket to use a plug pin capture device; if it's far enough out of the socket to expose the uninsulated portion of the pins, it is no longer far enough into the socket to be receiving voltage, and you've just interrupted the power, which is precisely what you don't want. The design of our wall sockets is such that there is no separate faceplate assembly; you'd have to take the entire socket off of the wall. Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power. Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can't know that the ring is no longer complete. In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you'd first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety. [2] I dare say this is more involved and riskier than simply carefully cutting into the equipment power cord. Also, good luck finding enough slack conductor behind a wall socket in order to pull this off.

I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that's just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge. I spent close to a week optimizing my setup looking at kernel flame graphs and perf results, reading adapter-specific tuning guides and driver source, and can say that the only really meaningful performance optimizations (in both the Broadwell- and Zen3/Vermeer-based implementations I tried) were disabling mitigations in the kernel (esp. on Zen3, that boosted performance by more than 20%), and getting CPU frequency scaling/idle states sorted out correctly (which yielded much higher wins on the older Broadwell uarch, because power state transition appears to happen much quicker on Zen3). As for the solution presented in the (on the whole really great; I love it!) article, I have my doubts about the effectiveness of the cargo-culted  \"sysctl tuning\" mentioned - TCP, for example, is simply not involved at all in the described setup, so \"tuning\" its buffer allocations cannot have any effect on the workload.

Otherwise, the CPUs/platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely. One can tweak things to reach a sweet spot in the middle, where you can achieve ~99% of the peak performance at very sensible idle power draw (i.e., ~25W when the link isn't loaded). With Zen3, this hardly mattered at all. I also got to witness that using IPv4 for the wireguard \"overlay\" network yielded about 30% better performance than when using IPv6 with ULA prefixes.

Just spit-balling a little, but I wonder if Wireguard is the best tool here given that the author is only using it for a single point-to-point link and they control the devices on both ends. That CPU supports AES-NI and probably does it a lot faster than Wireguard's ChaCha20 (hard to get numbers for their server CPU, but the tiny little x86 mini PC I use as my router does AES XTS at 43Gbps according to `cryptsetup benchmark`). You might see better performance by tunneling the vxlan connection using a different technology which can use AES-NI? Then again, Wireguard is definitely still a good tool for stuff like this, and maybe the performance penalty isn't a big deal here.    reply            alphager  1 day ago    | parent | next  [–]      AES can only encrypt up to 64TB; after that you need to re-key. So you need a mechanism for rekeying anyway. Definitely a good idea to use a battle-tested tool like wireguard instead of rolling your own.    reply            EE84M3i  23 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      >AES can only encrypt up to 64TB I've never heard that before.

In GCM mode there's a realistic chance of an IV being reused after around 64GB of data. Other modes have differing limits.    reply            zokier  15 hours ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      Umm...

Not trying to be argumentative, genuinely curious. My understanding is that AES has some design warts that make it not ideal (basically, it's easy to both implement and use in ways that leak information if you're not careful) but that it's still essentially perfect symmetric encryption if you're using it as recommended. Is that wrong? FWIW, the reason I brought up performance was because the OP spends a large chunk of the post talking about it, so I assume it's an important requirement for them.    reply            tptacek  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      It's not about AES, it's about the WireGuard protocol. AES is fine. It's possible that, if Jason had the decisions to do over again today, he might use XAES instead of ChaPoly (he didn't have an especially good AES construction to use at the time). The big thing with WireGuard is not doing ciphersuite negotiation, which is an extremely good decision that is definitely worth paying some cycles/byte for (if you must).    reply            rainsford  11 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Maybe I'm missing something, but why would he have needed XAES rather than vanilla AES-GCM, which was certainly available at the time WireGuard was created?  XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that's not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it's not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways. Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you're implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard's crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I'm not sure AES-GCM wouldn't have been the best (albeit less cool) choice. Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I'd bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.    reply            tptacek  8 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      WireGuard is an instantiation of Noise, which slightly disfavors AES-GCM (see: the spec). I don't think it's a huge big deal, but at the time WireGuard was being designed it was pretty normal to tack away from GCM. I agree in advance, Noise already uses counter-based nonces, the extended nonce wouldn't matter to vanilla Noise.    reply            wmf  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      AES is probably fine as a cipher but the VPN protocols that aren't Wireguard tend to have various footguns available.

I was thinking they could use something like DTLS [1] and tunnel just the one UDP port needed for their VXLAN connections, rather than use full-blown VPN software.

You'd run the \"real\" secure transports on top of that, the same way you do on internal networks today. In which case, yeah, it might make sense to select your protocol/constructions purely based on encryption efficiency.    reply            qhwudbebd  17 hours ago    | prev | next  [–]      I'm interested in their last step, in which they set  vm.dirty_ratio = 40\n  vm.dirty_background_ratio = 10\n  vm.swappiness=10\n\n  governor=performance\n  energy_perf_bias=performance\n  min_perf_pct=100 to raise a surprisingly low performance ceiling. I can't believe they were under any memory pressure, so the first three presumably made no difference, but it's also quite surprising to me that the default ondemand cpu governor was responsible for such a dramatic performance hit.

Quite amusingly it's the load isn't big enough for the default governor to rise the clock up to max.

I thought it was cooked up by the IEEE and supported in hardware from many vendors. I imagine they all have their own bugs though, it's quite a complicated spec. I know some switch/router vendors also now offer hardware-accelerated end-to-end encryption, similar to IPsec, Nokia call their's anysec but I'm sure the other players have their own.

They can move your server but they can't move the entire network, set up an encrypted tunnel between two distant physical servers and self destruct the moment that tunnel gets disrupted. Some computers come with gyros/accelerometers built in. My old HP laptop had some kind of head crash prevention that used that hardware.

Maybe getting a HP server can already get you a whole bunch of movement sensors. You could probably figure out if the server is being moved by measuring capacitance of the case, measuring accelerometers, maybe add a GPS dongle. Or you could add an LTE connector and measure any signals you may receive that you shouldn't from inside a server room. You can probably measure _something_ in the server room, though, so to make sure your LTE dongle doesn't get interrupted, also measure whatever reliable signal you can find to detect Faraday cages. Lastly, you could put a video camera in the case on all sides and measure changes. Detecting law enforcement badges probably isn't that hard with opencv if you're dedicated enough.

The insulation on plug pins prevents you pulling the plug far enough out of the socket to use a plug pin capture device; if it's far enough out of the socket to expose the uninsulated portion of the pins, it is no longer far enough into the socket to be receiving voltage, and you've just interrupted the power, which is precisely what you don't want. The design of our wall sockets is such that there is no separate faceplate assembly; you'd have to take the entire socket off of the wall. Excepting some exotic sockets (like the MK Logic Plus Rapid Fix), there is only one recessed insulated screw terminal for line and neutral and no holes to push conductors into [1], and loosening that screw to put another conductor in would also risk interrupting the power. Furthermore, most sockets are on ring circuits, and removing the socket from the wall creates a dangerous potential for an overcurrent condition on the now-incomplete ring, which the breaker will not respond to, as it can't know that the ring is no longer complete. In order to safely do socket surgery in this scenario, you'd first have to connect both lines and both neutrals together using something like a scotchlok connector. Then you can cut one of the line and neutral conductors from those to the socket. Finally, you can crimp onto the flying socket line and neutral from the vampire, and then cut the other line and neutral when the UPS is ready to feed the socket. This leaves exposed mains-potential conductors behind the wall which should be capped off by some form of scotchlok or crimp connector for occupant safety, and an exposed mains-potential conductor which should be capped off for officer and technician safety. [2] I dare say this is more involved and riskier than simply carefully cutting into the equipment power cord. Also, good luck finding enough slack conductor behind a wall socket in order to pull this off.

My solution ended up using tc's mirred[0] action for implementing a fully L2-transparent frame relay. I wonder if their setup achieves the same degree of transparency, because afaiui, that's just not possible involving a 802.1Q-compliant (Linux) bridge. I spent close to a week optimizing my setup looking at kernel flame graphs and perf results, reading adapter-specific tuning guides and driver source, and can say that the only really meaningful performance optimizations (in both the Broadwell- and Zen3/Vermeer-based implementations I tried) were disabling mitigations in the kernel (esp. on Zen3, that boosted performance by more than 20%), and getting CPU frequency scaling/idle states sorted out correctly (which yielded much higher wins on the older Broadwell uarch, because power state transition appears to happen much quicker on Zen3).

Otherwise, the CPUs/platform firmware will select to operate in a very dissatisfactory compromise between high-ish power consumption (~90W per socket), but substantially less performance than with having all idle states disabled (= CPU in POLL at all times, resulting in ~135W per core) completely.

AES is fine. It's possible that, if Jason had the decisions to do over again today, he might use XAES instead of ChaPoly (he didn't have an especially good AES construction to use at the time). The big thing with WireGuard is not doing ciphersuite negotiation, which is an extremely good decision that is definitely worth paying some cycles/byte for (if you must).    reply           tptacek  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      It's not about AES, it's about the WireGuard protocol.

XAES gives you large nonces which is cool, but that's not something WireGuard needs AFAIK and it's not something regular ChaPoly gives you anyways. Now I admit ChaPoly has some pretty nice advantages if you're implementing it in software.  But with the trend of AES-GCM hardware support and the long-lived nature of WireGuard's crypto choices given the lack of ciphersuite negotiation (which I agree was a good decision!), I'm not sure AES-GCM wouldn't have been the best (albeit less cool) choice. Although maybe on the other hand, ChaPoly can still be made to run pretty fast even just in software and it gives WireGuard the advantage of being more practical on very low-end devices that might lack AES-GCM hardware.  Avoiding ciphersuite negotiation means a tradeoff needs to be made somewhere, at least with current algorithms, and I'd bet line-rate hardware encryption is probably the least likely place to see WireGuard for a while at least, so maybe WireGuard did make the best tradeoff at the time.    reply           rainsford  11 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Maybe I'm missing something, but why would he have needed XAES rather than vanilla AES-GCM, which was certainly available at the time WireGuard was created?
