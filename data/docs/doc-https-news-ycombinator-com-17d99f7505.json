Fuzz testing is still not widely adopted considering the obvious benefits and usually minimum setup time. Even if it&#x27;s java, getting it to native code was a must, so I had to rewrite it from spring to quarkus to get native image compilation out of the box. And focus on the performance bit to be able to run large number of mutation even for large json payloads.

Fuzz testing is still not widely adopted considering the obvious benefits and usually minimum setup time. Even if it&#x27;s java, getting it to native code was a must, so I had to rewrite it from spring to quarkus to get native image compilation out of the box. And focus on the performance bit to be able to run large number of mutation even for large json payloads.
