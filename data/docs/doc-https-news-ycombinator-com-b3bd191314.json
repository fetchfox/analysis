In the default mode, all you have to do for configuration is tell it the names or IPs of things to monitor and an SNMP community string.

That's called SNMP MIBs, and LibreNMS has a lot of the standard/well known device MIBs to parse out the details. https://docs.librenms.org/Support/FAQ/#how-does-librenms-use...    reply            swills  6 hours ago    | prev | next  [–]      Once years ago a coworker set this up with good intentions of evaluating it and it ended up setting up a default automation which sent SNMP queries to a networked photocopier which triggered it to print some diagnostic page repeatedly until it ran out of paper overnight while no one was around. Anecdotal, but amusing to me and it's still the first thing that comes to mind when I see this product.    reply            ovation1357  2 hours ago    | prev | next  [–]      I've been managing multiple instances of the free \"Horizon\" version of OpenNMS for nearly 10 years, even contributed a couple of bug fixes. \nIt doesn't get much love from coworkers and it's an absolute beast to learn but it generally does the job. \nIt's got a LOT of bells and whistles including support for all sorts of Comms and IT gear.\nIt can be a tad clunky, pretty RAM and I/O intensive (Java) and the vast number of XML config files can be very daunting for new users. \nBut it largely does what's needed including custom detection and status polling of services, recieving and processing SNMP traps and polling SNNP metrics.\nThe built in graphs are useful but a bit old and ugly however it has Grafana integration and one day I'll look into trying that out. It heavyweight and very \"enterprise\" - not necessarily going to cut it for home or small business use, but if you've got a huge sprawl of legacy systems and applications then it might be a decent fit for centralised monitoring.    reply            TYPE_FASTER  5 hours ago    | prev | next  [–]      Found screenshots of the free version: https://www.opennms.com/horizon/#iLightbox[image_carousel_1]...    reply            AbraKdabra  5 hours ago    | prev | next  [–]      I've been using LibreNMS since 2014 and I even contributed to a feature, I can say it's in the top 3 SNMP monitoring tools, excellent tool.    reply            unsnap_biceps  6 hours ago    | prev | next  [–]      The pricing page shows the smallest plan is $12,000 a year.

That's called SNMP MIBs, and LibreNMS has a lot of the standard/well known device MIBs to parse out the details. https://docs.librenms.org/Support/FAQ/#how-does-librenms-use...    reply            swills  6 hours ago    | prev | next  [–]      Once years ago a coworker set this up with good intentions of evaluating it and it ended up setting up a default automation which sent SNMP queries to a networked photocopier which triggered it to print some diagnostic page repeatedly until it ran out of paper overnight while no one was around.

It heavyweight and very \"enterprise\" - not necessarily going to cut it for home or small business use, but if you've got a huge sprawl of legacy systems and applications then it might be a decent fit for centralised monitoring.    reply            TYPE_FASTER  5 hours ago    | prev | next  [–]      Found screenshots of the free version: https://www.opennms.com/horizon/#iLightbox[image_carousel_1]...    reply            AbraKdabra  5 hours ago    | prev | next  [–]      I've been using LibreNMS since 2014 and I even contributed to a feature, I can say it's in the top 3 SNMP monitoring tools, excellent tool.    reply            unsnap_biceps  6 hours ago    | prev | next  [–]      The pricing page shows the smallest plan is $12,000 a year.
