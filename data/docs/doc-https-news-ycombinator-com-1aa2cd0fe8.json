In effect, archeology is a licensed occupation, but then so is cutting hair in most US states.<p>If the story about metal in machinery is true, then really no offense was committed. Using a metal detector to find what you think is a loose horseshoe is fine. The story might also just be a convenient cover, but no-one will really care. In Ireland, authorities tend to be good natured and mostly only out to get egregious offenders.

As an Irish person who has spent some time working as an archaeological grunt (basically, I dig then as soon as I spot something, pass it over to a real archaeologist) - this is a hugely important law. Because, for large developers, the immediate response on finding something is to hide&#x2F;destroy it so that they don&#x27;t lose money while an archaeological survey is carried out. And for landowners, I wager a majority are likely to keep it as a curio if it doesn&#x27;t look valuable.<p>The fact is that owning a piece of farmland doesn&#x27;t give you ownership of our country&#x27;s heritage.

And this is especially important (and easy to enforce) if the building requires excavation anyway.<p>But secondly, as long as the building doesn&#x27;t destroy the site (say, the ruins&#x2F;remains are buried deep enough), then there is no problem, and the logic still applies: it will be found some few decades or centuries later, so chances are there will be more that can be gleaned from it then.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41542235&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341542235\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                              <tr class='athing comtr' id='41537725'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41537725' href='vote?id=41537725&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=TheRealPomax\" class=\"hnuser\">TheRealPomax</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T05:43:50.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41537725\">18 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41537725\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41535674\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41536042\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41536973\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41537725\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">There is no &quot;his own farmland&quot;.

The textbook example is a thurible, the censer on a chain used in churches. They&#x27;re not used because anyone specifically wants a lot of smoke in the air (a fog machine would do just fine) or because swinging them is fun, but rather because there&#x27;s a higher ritual purpose being served by those particular objects being used in those particular ways.<p>It&#x27;s like calling an object rugged or utilitarian. It&#x27;s not a statement on what you know about the object&#x27;s specific purpose, but rather an adjective describing something else entirely.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41536398&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341536398\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41536489'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='5'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"200\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41536489' href='vote?id=41536489&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=astrange\" class=\"hnuser\">astrange</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T00:25:19.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41536489\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41536489\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41534955\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41536398\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41538890\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41536489\" n=\"2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Hmm, isn&#x27;t rugged strongly associated with the purpose of something?

For instance, hoards or collections of objects were often deliberately placed in specific locations for reasons that could range from ritualistic to supernatural.”<p>Here is the link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.museum.ie&#x2F;en-IE&#x2F;News&#x2F;Appeal-for-information-about-Bronze-Age-Axeheads-F\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.museum.ie&#x2F;en-IE&#x2F;News&#x2F;Appeal-for-information-abou...</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41538398&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341538398\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41538854'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41538854' href='vote?id=41538854&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=s_dev\" class=\"hnuser\">s_dev</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T10:35:13.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41538854\">14 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41538854\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41534955\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41535845\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41536318\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41535583\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41538854\" n=\"2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">I interpret supernatural to mean religious in this context.

I use oat milk, but water is fine in a pinch. I add such a small amount of salt that it may as well be a placebo.<p>Here are my hard-earned porridge cooking tips, not that you asked:<p>Start soaking the oats the night before in the pot you&#x27;ll cook them in (in the fridge if you&#x27;re using dairy). This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot.<p>First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don&#x27;t need to stir them constantly, they&#x27;re extraordinarily creamy, and you won&#x27;t burn the oats to your pan.<p>Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you&#x27;re into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect.<p>And if you want to get real weird with it, add some pomegranate seeds. I don&#x27;t generally bother, because pomegranates are a bit of work, but it&#x27;s awesome.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41536261&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341536261\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41539213'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='4'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"160\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41539213' href='vote?id=41539213&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=ThaDood\" class=\"hnuser\">ThaDood</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T11:52:19.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41539213\">12 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41539213\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41535583\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41536261\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41537100\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41539213\" n=\"4\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Do you add milk or sugar to your tea?

Milk gets added after steeping so as not to scald. For the love of all that&#x27;s holy, don&#x27;t microwave the water. Use a kettle or a pot.<p>Green and most herbal tea gets neither milk nor sugar, but sometimes honey. Add a little cold water to the herbs first, so you don&#x27;t extract bitter compounds: using near 100C water is why so many people think they dislike green and herbal tea. (Ginger, hemp, chamomile and hibiscus are the main exceptions to this rule - they need boiling water for the floral flavours.)<p>I love coffee, but I have enough herbal tea to open an apothecary. Just be careful that you&#x27;re not getting teabags with plastic in them! Pukka are consistently great, as are Suki.<p>Favourite fancy biscuits are from the Island Bakery [0] in Scotland. Their Lemon Melts and their Chocolate Gingers are just about perfect. I know you can find their shortbread in the US, but not sure about other varieties. The biscuits come in a little cardboard boat and it&#x27;s adorable.<p>0 - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.islandbakery.scot&#x2F;product&#x2F;lemon-melts-2&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.islandbakery.scot&#x2F;product&#x2F;lemon-melts-2&#x2F;</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41539388&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341539388\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41537100'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='4'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"160\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41537100' href='vote?id=41537100&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=foobar1962\" class=\"hnuser\">foobar1962</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T02:45:03.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41537100\">21 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41537100\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41535583\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41536261\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41539213\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41539391\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41537100\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; Milk is preferable, with a splash of water.

Without these laws and effective enforcement of them, looters show up with bulldozers, metal detectors, and work crews in the middle of the night to dig up anything they can sell to what&#x27;s now a billion dollar global market. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time as an archaeologist looking at the aftermath and doing public education to stop it.<p>Antiquities laws are generally designed to make antiquities &quot;visible&quot; to the state while also giving authorities teeth if they need to go after these sorts of people. To do that, there&#x27;s a whole host of laws and conventions that require reporting virtually everything and align the financial incentives&#x2F;penalties to ensure valuations on any antiquities discovered are as reasonably accurate as possible. It makes things a little inconvenient for the hobbyists, but I personally find that a reasonable tradeoff given the damage that otherwise occurs.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41536180&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341536180\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41536192'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='2'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"80\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41536192' href='vote?id=41536192&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=gadders\" class=\"hnuser\">gadders</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-13T23:41:29.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41536192\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41536192\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41535674\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41536180\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41540212\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41536192\" n=\"7\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt;&gt;These laws are a balancing act between heritage conservation and civil rights like allowing people to enjoy metal detecting as a hobby.

Using a metal detector to find what you think is a loose horseshoe is fine. The story might also just be a convenient cover, but no-one will really care. In Ireland, authorities tend to be good natured and mostly only out to get egregious offenders.

As an Irish person who has spent some time working as an archaeological grunt (basically, I dig then as soon as I spot something, pass it over to a real archaeologist) - this is a hugely important law. Because, for large developers, the immediate response on finding something is to hide&#x2F;destroy it so that they don&#x27;t lose money while an archaeological survey is carried out. And for landowners, I wager a majority are likely to keep it as a curio if it doesn&#x27;t look valuable.<p>The fact is that owning a piece of farmland doesn&#x27;t give you ownership of our country&#x27;s heritage. Nor should it. You get to raise cows on the land. You don&#x27;t get to mine it (without permission), you don&#x27;t get to turn it into a housing development (without permission), and you don&#x27;t get to turn it into an archaeological dig site (without permission).</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41536924&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341536924\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41537732'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41537732' href='vote?id=41537732&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=ruiseal\" class=\"hnuser\">ruiseal</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T05:47:19.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41537732\">18 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41537732\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41535674\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41536924\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41538493\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41537732\" n=\"2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">In response to &quot;our country&#x27;s heritage&quot;: Ireland is not a person so the concept is entirely political.<p>And provided you don&#x27;t cause any negative externalities, you should have the default right to do whatever you want on your land.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41537732&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341537732\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41538366'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='4'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"160\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41538366' href='vote?id=41538366&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=krisoft\" class=\"hnuser\">krisoft</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T08:29:55.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41538366\">16 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41538366\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41535674\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41537732\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41538493\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41538366\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; Ireland is not a person so the concept is entirely political.<p>Of course.

The textbook example is a thurible, the censer on a chain used in churches. They&#x27;re not used because anyone specifically wants a lot of smoke in the air (a fog machine would do just fine) or because swinging them is fun, but rather because there&#x27;s a higher ritual purpose being served by those particular objects being used in those particular ways.<p>It&#x27;s like calling an object rugged or utilitarian. It&#x27;s not a statement on what you know about the object&#x27;s specific purpose, but rather an adjective describing something else entirely.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41536398&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341536398\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41536489'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='5'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"200\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41536489' href='vote?id=41536489&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=astrange\" class=\"hnuser\">astrange</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T00:25:19.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41536489\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41536489\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41534955\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41536398\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41538890\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41536489\" n=\"2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Hmm, isn&#x27;t rugged strongly associated with the purpose of something?

For instance, hoards or collections of objects were often deliberately placed in specific locations for reasons that could range from ritualistic to supernatural.”<p>Here is the link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.museum.ie&#x2F;en-IE&#x2F;News&#x2F;Appeal-for-information-about-Bronze-Age-Axeheads-F\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.museum.ie&#x2F;en-IE&#x2F;News&#x2F;Appeal-for-information-abou...</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41538398&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341538398\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41538854'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41538854' href='vote?id=41538854&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=s_dev\" class=\"hnuser\">s_dev</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T10:35:13.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41538854\">14 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41538854\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41534955\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41535845\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41536318\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41535583\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41538854\" n=\"2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">I interpret supernatural to mean religious in this context.

I use oat milk, but water is fine in a pinch. I add such a small amount of salt that it may as well be a placebo.<p>Here are my hard-earned porridge cooking tips, not that you asked:<p>Start soaking the oats the night before in the pot you&#x27;ll cook them in (in the fridge if you&#x27;re using dairy). This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot.<p>First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don&#x27;t need to stir them constantly, they&#x27;re extraordinarily creamy, and you won&#x27;t burn the oats to your pan.<p>Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you&#x27;re into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect.<p>And if you want to get real weird with it, add some pomegranate seeds. I don&#x27;t generally bother, because pomegranates are a bit of work, but it&#x27;s awesome.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41536261&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341536261\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41539213'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='4'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"160\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41539213' href='vote?id=41539213&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=ThaDood\" class=\"hnuser\">ThaDood</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T11:52:19.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41539213\">12 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41539213\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41535583\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41536261\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41537100\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41539213\" n=\"4\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Do you add milk or sugar to your tea?

Milk gets added after steeping so as not to scald. For the love of all that&#x27;s holy, don&#x27;t microwave the water. Use a kettle or a pot.<p>Green and most herbal tea gets neither milk nor sugar, but sometimes honey. Add a little cold water to the herbs first, so you don&#x27;t extract bitter compounds: using near 100C water is why so many people think they dislike green and herbal tea. (Ginger, hemp, chamomile and hibiscus are the main exceptions to this rule - they need boiling water for the floral flavours.)<p>I love coffee, but I have enough herbal tea to open an apothecary. Just be careful that you&#x27;re not getting teabags with plastic in them! Pukka are consistently great, as are Suki.<p>Favourite fancy biscuits are from the Island Bakery [0] in Scotland. Their Lemon Melts and their Chocolate Gingers are just about perfect. I know you can find their shortbread in the US, but not sure about other varieties. The biscuits come in a little cardboard boat and it&#x27;s adorable.<p>0 - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.islandbakery.scot&#x2F;product&#x2F;lemon-melts-2&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.islandbakery.scot&#x2F;product&#x2F;lemon-melts-2&#x2F;</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41539388&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709%2341539388\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41537100'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='4'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"160\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41537100' href='vote?id=41537100&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41501709'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=foobar1962\" class=\"hnuser\">foobar1962</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T02:45:03.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41537100\">21 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41537100\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41535583\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41536261\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41539213\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41539391\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41537100\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; Milk is preferable, with a splash of water.

I've spent a lot of time as an archaeologist looking at the aftermath and doing public education to stop it. Antiquities laws are generally designed to make antiquities \"visible\" to the state while also giving authorities teeth if they need to go after these sorts of people. To do that, there's a whole host of laws and conventions that require reporting virtually everything and align the financial incentives/penalties to ensure valuations on any antiquities discovered are as reasonably accurate as possible. It makes things a little inconvenient for the hobbyists, but I personally find that a reasonable tradeoff given the damage that otherwise occurs.    reply            gadders  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      >>These laws are a balancing act between heritage conservation and civil rights like allowing people to enjoy metal detecting as a hobby.

In England you need permission of the landowner (or which ever authority is responsible for a piece of public land) and must report any archeological finds.   There's a lot of illegal metal detecting at night - \"Nighthawking\", and fairly tough convictions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nighthawking https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-68445207    reply            subroutine  12 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Laws requiring permission from the land owner to use a metal detector and dig vs. needing such permission on your own land seems very different IMO. The English law seems focused on preventing trespassing and digging holes in people's yards, and also to make sure the land owner gets compensated for anything of value found. (e.g. from the link by madax below: In England \" An experienced detectorist, Davies would have known he was entitled to half of the proceeds of legal sale of the treasure, instead choosing to deprive the landowner and public by stealing this exceptional and significant treasure. \") The Irish law seems focused on preventing anything from being found.    reply            AlotOfReading  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      Effectively the same thing applies in the UK.

This solution is much worse than the cure.  Yes it's hard for governments to write narrowly tailored laws to achieve narrowly tailored objectives while avoiding loopholes.  That doesn't mean they should devolve into making overly broad laws and then enforcing those laws arbitrarily.  That's just behaving like a tyrant.    reply            fsckboy  23 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      > You have to write a plea to the government to request permission to use a metal detector on your own land? no, that's not the law (because you changed what you quoted). the law is \"you can't use a metal detector on your own property to search for archaeological objects without permission.\" You can use it as this farmer said he did as part of working your farm, although if you do find an archeological object I think you are required to leave it in place which he did not do.

In effect, archeology is a licensed occupation, but then so is cutting hair in most US states. If the story about metal in machinery is true, then really no offense was committed. Using a metal detector to find what you think is a loose horseshoe is fine. The story might also just be a convenient cover, but no-one will really care. In Ireland, authorities tend to be good natured and mostly only out to get egregious offenders. Maybe the metal detector guy has been looking for coins without permission, and it'll be handled at the level of \"ah here would you have a bit of cop on\".    reply            cwillu  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      “In effect, archeology is a licensed occupation, but then so is cutting hair in most US states.” This doesn't strengthen the argument.    reply            jkaplowitz  23 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      I do see some value in having the state license people who make a business of convincing strangers to allow them to use sharp cutting implements on their body in ways that, if not properly maintained and used, could lead to injury, to undesired slow-to-reverse harm to appearance, or to transmission of infestations like head lice.

Fact is, we as a species did not advance quickly enough to record our origins and a lot of our history.  Perhaps this kind of thing always happens.  Nobody knows and we have a sample size of one at present. Our history is a shared thing by our very human condition and the nature of history. Of course we benefit overall with policy like this even if at times a few of us feel wronged.    reply            mr_toad  20 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      A lot of people throughout history thought the world would end long before this because an issue.

But if mining company X suspects my plot can be mined, they can get permission to mine my plot before I do. They can't mine it if I don't let them, but if anyone is going to mine is the company. IIRC, a few years ago some company called Odyssey that go around trying to unearth gold from antiquity, was reminded by the government that in Spain you can't do that, and every single gram of gold you find is property of the State. https://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2021/10/19/616e897de4d4d8e73f...

A collection of stunning religious artefacts dating from the 9th century. This resulted in a whole legal mess where they were demanding a payment from the state of what would be arounf €25 million in todays money, after months of legal arguing they got a payout of what would be around €200k today. While this was ongoing there was an explosion in the number of people going out metal detecting for similar items and it's almost certain some items were found and not delcared to the state. So to protect the nations heritage - and we have a lot of it - from being scavenged these strict laws were introduced.    reply            antonvs  16 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      > your own land Your assumptions about what this means are parochial.

I think the greater concern for artifact loss is someone doing earthworks, finding something, and then not reporting it because they don't want to wait for archaeologists to check out the site.    reply            esperent  22 hours ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      So much will never be looted or destroyed because of this law. As an Irish person who has spent some time working as an archaeological grunt (basically, I dig then as soon as I spot something, pass it over to a real archaeologist) - this is a hugely important law. Because, for large developers, the immediate response on finding something is to hide/destroy it so that they don't lose money while an archaeological survey is carried out. And for landowners, I wager a majority are likely to keep it as a curio if it doesn't look valuable. The fact is that owning a piece of farmland doesn't give you ownership of our country's heritage. Nor should it. You get to raise cows on the land. You don't get to mine it (without permission), you don't get to turn it into a housing development (without permission), and you don't get to turn it into an archaeological dig site (without permission).    reply            ruiseal  18 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      In response to \"our country's heritage\": Ireland is not a person so the concept is entirely political.

Of course, this has to be balanced with some amount of excavation to actually improve those methods, and with enough information being gleaned today to keep us interested in actually funding the practice of archaeology for tomorrow.    reply            profsummergig  5 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Templo Mayor.

And this is especially important (and easy to enforce) if the building requires excavation anyway. But secondly, as long as the building doesn't destroy the site (say, the ruins/remains are buried deep enough), then there is no problem, and the logic still applies: it will be found some few decades or centuries later, so chances are there will be more that can be gleaned from it then.    reply            TheRealPomax  18 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      There is no \"his own farmland\".

Archaeologists are meticulous about recording these little details because every any one of them could become important to the investigation.

They're not used because anyone specifically wants a lot of smoke in the air (a fog machine would do just fine) or because swinging them is fun, but rather because there's a higher ritual purpose being served by those particular objects being used in those particular ways.

Here are my hard-earned porridge cooking tips, not that you asked: Start soaking the oats the night before in the pot you'll cook them in (in the fridge if you're using dairy). This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot. First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don't need to stir them constantly, they're extraordinarily creamy, and you won't burn the oats to your pan. Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you're into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect. And if you want to get real weird with it, add some pomegranate seeds.

There's little reason to want to maximize the amount you're excavating right now. Unless your goal is to find treasure and profit somehow.

As an Irish person who has spent some time working as an archaeological grunt (basically, I dig then as soon as I spot something, pass it over to a real archaeologist) - this is a hugely important law. Because, for large developers, the immediate response on finding something is to hide/destroy it so that they don't lose money while an archaeological survey is carried out. And for landowners, I wager a majority are likely to keep it as a curio if it doesn't look valuable. The fact is that owning a piece of farmland doesn't give you ownership of our country's heritage. Nor should it. You get to raise cows on the land. You don't get to mine it (without permission), you don't get to turn it into a housing development (without permission), and you don't get to turn it into an archaeological dig site (without permission).    reply            ruiseal  18 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      In response to \"our country's heritage\": Ireland is not a person so the concept is entirely political.

Archaeologists are meticulous about recording these little details because every any one of them could become important to the investigation.

Here are my hard-earned porridge cooking tips, not that you asked: Start soaking the oats the night before in the pot you'll cook them in (in the fridge if you're using dairy). This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot. First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don't need to stir them constantly, they're extraordinarily creamy, and you won't burn the oats to your pan. Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you're into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect. And if you want to get real weird with it, add some pomegranate seeds.

But if mining company X suspects my plot can be mined, they can get permission to mine my plot before I do. They can't mine it if I don't let them, but if anyone is going to mine is the company.

As an Irish person who has spent some time working as an archaeological grunt (basically, I dig then as soon as I spot something, pass it over to a real archaeologist) - this is a hugely important law. Because, for large developers, the immediate response on finding something is to hide/destroy it so that they don't lose money while an archaeological survey is carried out. And for landowners, I wager a majority are likely to keep it as a curio if it doesn't look valuable. The fact is that owning a piece of farmland doesn't give you ownership of our country's heritage.

Archaeologists are meticulous about recording these little details because every any one of them could become important to the investigation.

Here are my hard-earned porridge cooking tips, not that you asked: Start soaking the oats the night before in the pot you'll cook them in (in the fridge if you're using dairy). This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot. First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don't need to stir them constantly, they're extraordinarily creamy, and you won't burn the oats to your pan. Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you're into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect. And if you want to get real weird with it, add some pomegranate seeds.

Because, for large developers, the immediate response on finding something is to hide/destroy it so that they don't lose money while an archaeological survey is carried out.

Archaeologists are meticulous about recording these little details because every any one of them could become important to the investigation.

Here are my hard-earned porridge cooking tips, not that you asked: Start soaking the oats the night before in the pot you'll cook them in (in the fridge if you're using dairy). This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot. First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don't need to stir them constantly, they're extraordinarily creamy, and you won't burn the oats to your pan. Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you're into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect.

This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot. First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don't need to stir them constantly, they're extraordinarily creamy, and you won't burn the oats to your pan. Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you're into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect.

As an Irish person who has spent some time working as an archaeological grunt (basically, I dig then as soon as I spot something, pass it over to a real archaeologist) - this is a hugely important law. Because, for large developers, the immediate response on finding something is to hide/destroy it so that they don't lose money while an archaeological survey is carried out. And for landowners, I wager a majority are likely to keep it as a curio if it doesn't look valuable. The fact is that owning a piece of farmland doesn't give you ownership of our country's heritage.

This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot. First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don't need to stir them constantly, they're extraordinarily creamy, and you won't burn the oats to your pan. Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you're into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect.

It makes things a little inconvenient for the hobbyists, but I personally find that a reasonable tradeoff given the damage that otherwise occurs.    reply            gadders  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      >>These laws are a balancing act between heritage conservation and civil rights like allowing people to enjoy metal detecting as a hobby.

As an Irish person who has spent some time working as an archaeological grunt (basically, I dig then as soon as I spot something, pass it over to a real archaeologist) - this is a hugely important law. Because, for large developers, the immediate response on finding something is to hide/destroy it so that they don't lose money while an archaeological survey is carried out. And for landowners, I wager a majority are likely to keep it as a curio if it doesn't look valuable. The fact is that owning a piece of farmland doesn't give you ownership of our country's heritage.

This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot. First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don't need to stir them constantly, they're extraordinarily creamy, and you won't burn the oats to your pan. Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you're into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect.

This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot. First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don't need to stir them constantly, they're extraordinarily creamy, and you won't burn the oats to your pan. Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you're into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect.

Here are my hard-earned porridge cooking tips, not that you asked: Start soaking the oats the night before in the pot you'll cook them in (in the fridge if you're using dairy). This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot. First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don't need to stir them constantly, they're extraordinarily creamy, and you won't burn the oats to your pan. Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you're into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect. And if you want to get real weird with it, add some pomegranate seeds.

Milk gets added after steeping so as not to scald. For the love of all that's holy, don't microwave the water. Use a kettle or a pot. Green and most herbal tea gets neither milk nor sugar, but sometimes honey. Add a little cold water to the herbs first, so you don't extract bitter compounds: using near 100C water is why so many people think they dislike green and herbal tea. (Ginger, hemp, chamomile and hibiscus are the main exceptions to this rule - they need boiling water for the floral flavours.) I love coffee, but I have enough herbal tea to open an apothecary. Just be careful that you're not getting teabags with plastic in them! Pukka are consistently great, as are Suki. Favourite fancy biscuits are from the Island Bakery [0] in Scotland. Their Lemon Melts and their Chocolate Gingers are just about perfect. I know you can find their shortbread in the US, but not sure about other varieties. The biscuits come in a little cardboard boat and it's adorable. 0 - https://www.islandbakery.scot/product/lemon-melts-2/    reply            foobar1962  21 hours ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      > Milk is preferable, with a splash of water.

The textbook example is a thurible, the censer on a chain used in churches. They're not used because anyone specifically wants a lot of smoke in the air (a fog machine would do just fine) or because swinging them is fun, but rather because there's a higher ritual purpose being served by those particular objects being used in those particular ways. It's like calling an object rugged or utilitarian.

I use oat milk, but water is fine in a pinch. I add such a small amount of salt that it may as well be a placebo. Here are my hard-earned porridge cooking tips, not that you asked: Start soaking the oats the night before in the pot you'll cook them in (in the fridge if you're using dairy). This softens the oats and reduces cooking time by a lot. First thing in the morning, cook them on the lowest heat for about 20 minutes while you do your routine. This way you don't need to stir them constantly, they're extraordinarily creamy, and you won't burn the oats to your pan. Then add a touch of cream (or milk) to your bowl to cool the oats down some, and add some maple syrup if you're into decadence. Ultra low effort, maximum effect. And if you want to get real weird with it, add some pomegranate seeds. I don't generally bother, because pomegranates are a bit of work, but it's awesome.    reply           mandmandam  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Milk is preferable, with a splash of water.

Milk gets added after steeping so as not to scald. For the love of all that's holy, don't microwave the water. Use a kettle or a pot. Green and most herbal tea gets neither milk nor sugar, but sometimes honey. Add a little cold water to the herbs first, so you don't extract bitter compounds: using near 100C water is why so many people think they dislike green and herbal tea. (Ginger, hemp, chamomile and hibiscus are the main exceptions to this rule - they need boiling water for the floral flavours.) I love coffee, but I have enough herbal tea to open an apothecary. Just be careful that you're not getting teabags with plastic in them! Pukka are consistently great, as are Suki. Favourite fancy biscuits are from the Island Bakery [0] in Scotland. Their Lemon Melts and their Chocolate Gingers are just about perfect. I know you can find their shortbread in the US, but not sure about other varieties. The biscuits come in a little cardboard boat and it's adorable. 0 - https://www.islandbakery.scot/product/lemon-melts-2/    reply           mandmandam  12 hours ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      When I drink black tea it's with milk, using freshly boiled water (allow bubbling to stop) in a preheated cup.
