Whether intentional or an oversight, the omission was odd, especially since his target audience was Americans, and Obama didn’t want his speech to sound too “European.””<p>As you can see “claims to admire” didn’t originate from me.<p>Perhaps you didn’t read the article?</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41541048&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531383%2341541048\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41540390'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41540390' href='vote?id=41540390&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531383'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=k3vinw\" class=\"hnuser\">k3vinw</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-14T15:22:43.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41540390\">9 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41540390\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41540254\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41540411\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41540390\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">“I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”<p>Martin Luther King, Jr.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41540390&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41531383%2341540390\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  </table>\n  <br><br>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"10\" width=\"0\"><table width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"><tr><td bgcolor=\"#ff6600\"></td></tr></table><br>\n<center><span class=\"yclinks\"><a href=\"newsguidelines.html\">Guidelines</a> | <a href=\"newsfaq.html\">FAQ</a> | <a href=\"lists\">Lists</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/HackerNews/API\">API</a> | <a href=\"security.html\">Security</a> | <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/legal/\">Legal</a> | <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/\">Apply to YC</a> | <a href=\"mailto:hn@ycombinator.com\">Contact</a></span><br><br>\n<form method=\"get\" action=\"//hn.algolia.com/\">Search: <input type=\"text\" name=\"q\" size=\"17\" autocorrect=\"off\" spellcheck=\"false\" autocapitalize=\"off\" autocomplete=\"off\"></form></center></td></tr>      </table></center></body>\n      <script type='text/javascript' src='hn.js?u0LUEXpE1l7JwndlBn23'></script>\n  </html>\n",
