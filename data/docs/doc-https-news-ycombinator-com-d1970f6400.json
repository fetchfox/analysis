Compiled functions in windows DLLs have a 5 byte prologue of nop instructions which is just long enough to overwrite with a jmp instruction to hook the function call and redirect it. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;oldnewthing&#x2F;20110921-00&#x2F;?p=9583\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;oldnewthing&#x2F;20110921-00&#x2F;?p=95...</a>  In WinXP they started compiling this nop prologue in on purpose due to how useful it was. Before that, reverse engineers would need to get a bit lucky and find “room” for a jmp in some code path that was guaranteed to hit, in order to patch an executable without crashing it (iirc, i’m fuzzy on the details). Anyway, certainly not impossible, and we’d al be surprised by what can be made practical if the need is great enough.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41597221&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341597221\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41602293'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41602293' href='vote?id=41602293&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=robocat\" class=\"hnuser\">robocat</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-20T14:22:04.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41602293\">9 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41602293\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593562\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41597221\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593813\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41602293\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; 5 byte prologue of nop instructions<p>Has this been around long enough that CPUs optimise it out?<p>I presume there is a long list of CPU optimisations that are specific to the quirks of Windows object code . . .</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41602293&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341602293\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                        <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593813'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593813' href='vote?id=41593813&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=AtlasBarfed\" class=\"hnuser\">AtlasBarfed</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T16:50:32.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593813\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593813\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593562\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41596910\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41594275\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593813\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">You want an msr&#x2F;LFTR and breed away the bad waste.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593813&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341593813\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41594275'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41594275' href='vote?id=41594275&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=colechristensen\" class=\"hnuser\">colechristensen</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T17:36:48.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41594275\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41594275\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593562\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593813\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41592782\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41594275\" n=\"8\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">You&#x27;re thinking about the atom very classically, At the scale of the nucleus things just don&#x27;t &quot;exist&quot; in &quot;places&quot;.  Processes are truly random and things literally don&#x27;t have position&#x2F;momentum&#x2F;rotation&#x2F;alignment until you do the thing that requires them to decide where they were and what they were doing at the time.<p>Simpler than nuclear physics is just the electron.  There is no meaningful answer to where it is around an atom at any particular time.  You can either get a location or a momentum or half the information about each if you poke it, but that&#x27;s just its response to being poked, it wasn&#x27;t &quot;actually&quot; there until you poked it.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41594275&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341594275\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41606488'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='2'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"80\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41606488' href='vote?id=41606488&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px;

Hyperfine qubits are pretty common using neutral atoms, and you can do imaging on the hyperfine states. Is the novelty here that the electron spin is on resonance with the nuclear spin and that it’s done with STM? I guess I don’t see how pump-probe is so much more direct than using an imaging transition.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593255&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341593255\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41596448'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41596448' href='vote?id=41596448&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=quantadev\" class=\"hnuser\">quantadev</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T21:14:09.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41596448\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41596448\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593255\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41592717\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41596448\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">I think the key thing they were pointing out was the ability to store information inside a nucleus that can be read back (reminds me of how core memory worked on the old Apollo 11 Era computers) which could be a very reliable and dense memory. It&#x27;s reliable because the electron shell is sort of protecting the information stored inside the nucleus.<p>I wonder if they&#x27;ll have the same issue that core memory also had which is that by reading the magnetic state you also destroy that state, and so every bit &#x27;read&#x27; operation has to be followed with a &#x27;now write the bit back again&#x27; step.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41596448&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341596448\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41592717'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='0'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41592717' href='vote?id=41592717&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=notum\" class=\"hnuser\">notum</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T15:08:13.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41592717\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41592717\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593255\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41592717\" n=\"22\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext cCE\">CTRL+F &quot;entanglement&quot;.

Entanglement lets you do some fun and theoretically useful stuff for communication tasks. At the most basic level sharing entanglement lets you upgrade a classical communication channels you have into a quantum one (sending 2 bits and burning an entangled pair lets you send a qubit). You can do increasing fancy stuff if you so wish, if you are sufficiently paranoid you might be interested in device independent cryptography, which is only possible because of entanglement.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593078&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341593078\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41595697'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41595697' href='vote?id=41595697&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=roywiggins\" class=\"hnuser\">roywiggins</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T19:51:00.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41595697\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41595697\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592717\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41593078\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593073\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41595697\" n=\"4\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Yes, they are fun, but not notably useful, at least not yet.

It doesn&#x27;t exist. There is no global now. Different observers who are in different places and&#x2F;or moving at different speeds will describe different events as simultaneous.<p>In particular say we have an observer who sees an event A happening at time 0, and a second event (call it B) at time t and the distance between them is greater than c t. Then you can find observers who see A happening first, B happening first or the two happening at the same time. However all observers will agree that the distance between the events was greater than c times the time between them.<p>This seems like it would cause problems with causality, but it doesn&#x27;t because we need the distance to be greater than c times the time, which means no lightspeed signal could get from A to B. If you allow ftl communication then this &quot;escape&quot; doesn&#x27;t work anymore, and causality can be explicitly broken.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41594150&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341594150\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593950'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593950' href='vote?id=41593950&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=shepardrtc\" class=\"hnuser\">shepardrtc</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T17:04:45.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593950\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593950\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592717\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41593622\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41594150\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41596530\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593950\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">When you communicate, you&#x27;re sending energy - whether it&#x27;s sound waves or radio waves or whatever.

Two observers moving at different speeds with respect to each other see different time flows. At normal speeds this is negligible but at close to light speed... hoo boy. You get things like observers seeing events occur separately that occured simultaneously for their counterparts and so forth. So <i>if</i> you were able to send information faster than light somehow, you would be sending it from one frame of reference with one notion of time into another frame of reference with a different notion of time -- one which observes receipt of the message before it can observe the sender sending it!<p>It&#x27;s all a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41596501&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341596501\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41592872'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='2'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"80\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41592872' href='vote?id=41592872&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=josefritzishere\" class=\"hnuser\">josefritzishere</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T15:23:27.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41592872\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41592872\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592717\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41592799\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593622\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41592872\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">I had to google ansible. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ansible\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ansible</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41592872&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341592872\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                        </table>\n  <br><br>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"10\" width=\"0\"><table width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"><tr><td bgcolor=\"#ff6600\"></td></tr></table><br>\n<center><span class=\"yclinks\"><a href=\"newsguidelines.html\">Guidelines</a> | <a href=\"newsfaq.html\">FAQ</a> | <a href=\"lists\">Lists</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/HackerNews/API\">API</a> | <a href=\"security.html\">Security</a> | <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/legal/\">Legal</a> | <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/\">Apply to YC</a> | <a href=\"mailto:hn@ycombinator.com\">Contact</a></span><br><br>\n<form method=\"get\" action=\"//hn.algolia.com/\">Search: <input type=\"text\" name=\"q\" size=\"17\" autocorrect=\"off\" spellcheck=\"false\" autocapitalize=\"off\" autocomplete=\"off\"></form></center></td></tr>      </table></center></body>\n      <script type='text/javascript' src='hn.js?0NerTADr4LhIT46mBhBV'></script>\n  </html>\n",

Compiled functions in windows DLLs have a 5 byte prologue of nop instructions which is just long enough to overwrite with a jmp instruction to hook the function call and redirect it. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;oldnewthing&#x2F;20110921-00&#x2F;?p=9583\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;oldnewthing&#x2F;20110921-00&#x2F;?p=95...</a>  In WinXP they started compiling this nop prologue in on purpose due to how useful it was. Before that, reverse engineers would need to get a bit lucky and find “room” for a jmp in some code path that was guaranteed to hit, in order to patch an executable without crashing it (iirc, i’m fuzzy on the details). Anyway, certainly not impossible, and we’d al be surprised by what can be made practical if the need is great enough.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41597221&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341597221\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41602293'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41602293' href='vote?id=41602293&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=robocat\" class=\"hnuser\">robocat</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-20T14:22:04.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41602293\">9 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41602293\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593562\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41597221\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593813\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41602293\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; 5 byte prologue of nop instructions<p>Has this been around long enough that CPUs optimise it out?<p>I presume there is a long list of CPU optimisations that are specific to the quirks of Windows object code . . .</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41602293&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341602293\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                        <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593813'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593813' href='vote?id=41593813&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=AtlasBarfed\" class=\"hnuser\">AtlasBarfed</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T16:50:32.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593813\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593813\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593562\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41596910\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41594275\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593813\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">You want an msr&#x2F;LFTR and breed away the bad waste.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593813&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341593813\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41594275'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41594275' href='vote?id=41594275&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=colechristensen\" class=\"hnuser\">colechristensen</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T17:36:48.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41594275\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41594275\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593562\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593813\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41592782\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41594275\" n=\"8\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">You&#x27;re thinking about the atom very classically, At the scale of the nucleus things just don&#x27;t &quot;exist&quot; in &quot;places&quot;.

Hyperfine qubits are pretty common using neutral atoms, and you can do imaging on the hyperfine states. Is the novelty here that the electron spin is on resonance with the nuclear spin and that it’s done with STM? I guess I don’t see how pump-probe is so much more direct than using an imaging transition.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593255&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341593255\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41596448'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41596448' href='vote?id=41596448&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=quantadev\" class=\"hnuser\">quantadev</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T21:14:09.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41596448\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41596448\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593255\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41592717\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41596448\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">I think the key thing they were pointing out was the ability to store information inside a nucleus that can be read back (reminds me of how core memory worked on the old Apollo 11 Era computers) which could be a very reliable and dense memory. It&#x27;s reliable because the electron shell is sort of protecting the information stored inside the nucleus.<p>I wonder if they&#x27;ll have the same issue that core memory also had which is that by reading the magnetic state you also destroy that state, and so every bit &#x27;read&#x27; operation has to be followed with a &#x27;now write the bit back again&#x27; step.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41596448&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341596448\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41592717'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='0'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41592717' href='vote?id=41592717&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=notum\" class=\"hnuser\">notum</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T15:08:13.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41592717\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41592717\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593255\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41592717\" n=\"22\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext cCE\">CTRL+F &quot;entanglement&quot;.

Entanglement lets you do some fun and theoretically useful stuff for communication tasks. At the most basic level sharing entanglement lets you upgrade a classical communication channels you have into a quantum one (sending 2 bits and burning an entangled pair lets you send a qubit). You can do increasing fancy stuff if you so wish, if you are sufficiently paranoid you might be interested in device independent cryptography, which is only possible because of entanglement.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593078&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341593078\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41595697'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41595697' href='vote?id=41595697&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=roywiggins\" class=\"hnuser\">roywiggins</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T19:51:00.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41595697\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41595697\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592717\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41593078\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593073\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41595697\" n=\"4\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Yes, they are fun, but not notably useful, at least not yet.

It doesn&#x27;t exist. There is no global now. Different observers who are in different places and&#x2F;or moving at different speeds will describe different events as simultaneous.<p>In particular say we have an observer who sees an event A happening at time 0, and a second event (call it B) at time t and the distance between them is greater than c t. Then you can find observers who see A happening first, B happening first or the two happening at the same time. However all observers will agree that the distance between the events was greater than c times the time between them.<p>This seems like it would cause problems with causality, but it doesn&#x27;t because we need the distance to be greater than c times the time, which means no lightspeed signal could get from A to B. If you allow ftl communication then this &quot;escape&quot; doesn&#x27;t work anymore, and causality can be explicitly broken.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41594150&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341594150\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593950'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593950' href='vote?id=41593950&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=shepardrtc\" class=\"hnuser\">shepardrtc</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T17:04:45.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593950\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593950\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592717\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41593622\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41594150\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41596530\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593950\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">When you communicate, you&#x27;re sending energy - whether it&#x27;s sound waves or radio waves or whatever.

Two observers moving at different speeds with respect to each other see different time flows. At normal speeds this is negligible but at close to light speed... hoo boy. You get things like observers seeing events occur separately that occured simultaneously for their counterparts and so forth. So <i>if</i> you were able to send information faster than light somehow, you would be sending it from one frame of reference with one notion of time into another frame of reference with a different notion of time -- one which observes receipt of the message before it can observe the sender sending it!<p>It&#x27;s all a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41596501&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341596501\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41592872'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='2'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"80\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41592872' href='vote?id=41592872&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=josefritzishere\" class=\"hnuser\">josefritzishere</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T15:23:27.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41592872\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41592872\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592717\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41592799\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593622\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41592872\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">I had to google ansible. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ansible\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ansible</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41592872&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41591906%2341592872\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                        </table>\n  <br><br>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"10\" width=\"0\"><table width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"><tr><td bgcolor=\"#ff6600\"></td></tr></table><br>\n<center><span class=\"yclinks\"><a href=\"newsguidelines.html\">Guidelines</a> | <a href=\"newsfaq.html\">FAQ</a> | <a href=\"lists\">Lists</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/HackerNews/API\">API</a> | <a href=\"security.html\">Security</a> | <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/legal/\">Legal</a> | <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/\">Apply to YC</a> | <a href=\"mailto:hn@ycombinator.com\">Contact</a></span><br><br>\n<form method=\"get\" action=\"//hn.algolia.com/\">Search: <input type=\"text\" name=\"q\" size=\"17\" autocorrect=\"off\" spellcheck=\"false\" autocapitalize=\"off\" autocomplete=\"off\"></form></center></td></tr>      </table></center></body>\n      <script type='text/javascript' src='hn.js?0NerTADr4LhIT46mBhBV'></script>\n  </html>\n",

This would allow fission power without any long-lived waste products or afterglow heat cooling challenges that dominate accident risk. Physicist friends have told me it's impossible. I've only accepted impractical for now.    reply            fastneutron  5 minutes ago    | parent | next  [–]      Now that’s what I’d call nuclear engineering! More seriously, spin polarized D-T fusion is known to have an enhanced reaction cross section, so there are labs out there researching how to implement it more reliably.    reply            fooker  1 day ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      In software terms, this would be as difficult as switching out specific bits from a running program to fix bugs. Certainly not impossible, but impractical as far as we can see.    reply            dustingetz  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      that’s pretty much how windows update works (or used to work) to attempt to hot patch certain things without a reboot. Compiled functions in windows DLLs have a 5 byte prologue of nop instructions which is just long enough to overwrite with a jmp instruction to hook the function call and redirect it. https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110921-00/?p=95... In WinXP they started compiling this nop prologue in on purpose due to how useful it was. Before that, reverse engineers would need to get a bit lucky and find “room” for a jmp in some code path that was guaranteed to hit, in order to patch an executable without crashing it (iirc, i’m fuzzy on the details). Anyway, certainly not impossible, and we’d al be surprised by what can be made practical if the need is great enough.    reply            robocat  9 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      > 5 byte prologue of nop instructions Has this been around long enough that CPUs optimise it out?

Processes are truly random and things literally don't have position/momentum/rotation/alignment until you do the thing that requires them to decide where they were and what they were doing at the time. Simpler than nuclear physics is just the electron.  There is no meaningful answer to where it is around an atom at any particular time.  You can either get a location or a momentum or half the information about each if you poke it, but that's just its response to being poked, it wasn't \"actually\" there until you poked it.    reply            arcbyte  7 minutes ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      I'm a big believer in Energy Wave Theory.    reply            fooker  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      > Processes are truly random You can get a Nobel prize or two by proving this.

By correctly molding the energy landscape it may be possible to set the states and state transitions up in a beneficial way for what he proposed.    reply            colechristensen  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Eh, not really.  You can futz with the probability distribution, like a fast neutron will cause a different distribution of fission products than a slow one... but it is still a very random process.  You can't control it like an expert at a billiards table.  Especially the strong force mediated interactions between particles in the nucleus.

Hyperfine qubits are pretty common using neutral atoms, and you can do imaging on the hyperfine states. Is the novelty here that the electron spin is on resonance with the nuclear spin and that it’s done with STM? I guess I don’t see how pump-probe is so much more direct than using an imaging transition.    reply            quantadev  1 day ago    | parent | next  [–]      I think the key thing they were pointing out was the ability to store information inside a nucleus that can be read back (reminds me of how core memory worked on the old Apollo 11 Era computers) which could be a very reliable and dense memory. It's reliable because the electron shell is sort of protecting the information stored inside the nucleus. I wonder if they'll have the same issue that core memory also had which is that by reading the magnetic state you also destroy that state, and so every bit 'read' operation has to be followed with a 'now write the bit back again' step.    reply            notum  1 day ago    | prev  [–]      CTRL+F \"entanglement\".

In special relativity this global \"now\" isn't a thing. It doesn't exist. There is no global now. Different observers who are in different places and/or moving at different speeds will describe different events as simultaneous. In particular say we have an observer who sees an event A happening at time 0, and a second event (call it B) at time t and the distance between them is greater than c t. Then you can find observers who see A happening first, B happening first or the two happening at the same time. However all observers will agree that the distance between the events was greater than c times the time between them. This seems like it would cause problems with causality, but it doesn't because we need the distance to be greater than c times the time, which means no lightspeed signal could get from A to B. If you allow ftl communication then this \"escape\" doesn't work anymore, and causality can be explicitly broken.    reply            shepardrtc  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      When you communicate, you're sending energy - whether it's sound waves or radio waves or whatever.

Seriously, I've had it explained several times over the years.    reply            eigenket  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Its probably mostly because you have an intuitive idea that there is some concept of \"now\" which is independent of the observer. In special relativity this global \"now\" isn't a thing. It doesn't exist. There is no global now. Different observers who are in different places and/or moving at different speeds will describe different events as simultaneous. In particular say we have an observer who sees an event A happening at time 0, and a second event (call it B) at time t and the distance between them is greater than c t. Then you can find observers who see A happening first, B happening first or the two happening at the same time. However all observers will agree that the distance between the events was greater than c times the time between them. This seems like it would cause problems with causality, but it doesn't because we need the distance to be greater than c times the time, which means no lightspeed signal could get from A to B. If you allow ftl communication then this \"escape\" doesn't work anymore, and causality can be explicitly broken.    reply            shepardrtc  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      When you communicate, you're sending energy - whether it's sound waves or radio waves or whatever.  Energy can't travel faster than c through spacetime.  Now if you manipulate spacetime, such as a wormhole or whatever, then the end result can effectively appear as if it's FTL but its still going at c, its just traveling through less/compressed space.    reply            quantadev  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      One intuitive explanation is that anything moving at the speed of light is experiencing no time at all (from the point of view of an observer) and if something is moving faster than light that means it's going backwards in time. (only massless virtual particles can) If a clock stops or runs backwards that totally messes up \"causality\" which is about events interacting relative to a time order, and so time must exist for causality to make sense.    reply            Ono-Sendai  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      https://forwardscattering.org/post/36    reply            roywiggins  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      If you did manage FTL communication, it seems like it might let you detect the notional absolute rest frame, so you'd be breaking special relativity anyway.    reply            Ono-Sendai  20 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Yeah that's the point of the article really.

That said their are protocols, like the one invented by Artur Ekert in 1991, which use entanglement in an essential way to transmit the key.

The reason still seem to be related to the uncertainty principle although I am not sure. The same way they explain no-cloning but it seems to be analogous to identity within a system with interaction from neighboring data.\nUltimately there is no pure independent state.

In special relativity this global \"now\" isn't a thing. It doesn't exist. There is no global now. Different observers who are in different places and/or moving at different speeds will describe different events as simultaneous. In particular say we have an observer who sees an event A happening at time 0, and a second event (call it B) at time t and the distance between them is greater than c t. Then you can find observers who see A happening first, B happening first or the two happening at the same time. However all observers will agree that the distance between the events was greater than c times the time between them. This seems like it would cause problems with causality, but it doesn't because we need the distance to be greater than c times the time, which means no lightspeed signal could get from A to B.

In special relativity this global \"now\" isn't a thing. It doesn't exist. There is no global now. Different observers who are in different places and/or moving at different speeds will describe different events as simultaneous. In particular say we have an observer who sees an event A happening at time 0, and a second event (call it B) at time t and the distance between them is greater than c t. Then you can find observers who see A happening first, B happening first or the two happening at the same time. However all observers will agree that the distance between the events was greater than c times the time between them. This seems like it would cause problems with causality, but it doesn't because we need the distance to be greater than c times the time, which means no lightspeed signal could get from A to B.

In WinXP they started compiling this nop prologue in on purpose due to how useful it was.

Simpler than nuclear physics is just the electron.  There is no meaningful answer to where it is around an atom at any particular time.

Hyperfine qubits are pretty common using neutral atoms, and you can do imaging on the hyperfine states.

It's reliable because the electron shell is sort of protecting the information stored inside the nucleus. I wonder if they'll have the same issue that core memory also had which is that by reading the magnetic state you also destroy that state, and so every bit 'read' operation has to be followed with a 'now write the bit back again' step.    reply            notum  1 day ago    | prev  [–]      CTRL+F \"entanglement\".

Compiled functions in windows DLLs have a 5 byte prologue of nop instructions which is just long enough to overwrite with a jmp instruction to hook the function call and redirect it. https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110921-00/?p=95... In WinXP they started compiling this nop prologue in on purpose due to how useful it was. Before that, reverse engineers would need to get a bit lucky and find “room” for a jmp in some code path that was guaranteed to hit, in order to patch an executable without crashing it (iirc, i’m fuzzy on the details). Anyway, certainly not impossible, and we’d al be surprised by what can be made practical if the need is great enough.    reply           dustingetz  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      that’s pretty much how windows update works (or used to work) to attempt to hot patch certain things without a reboot.

The same way they explain no-cloning but it seems to be analogous to identity within a system with interaction from neighboring data.\nUltimately there is no pure independent state.

In special relativity this global \"now\" isn't a thing. It doesn't exist. There is no global now. Different observers who are in different places and/or moving at different speeds will describe different events as simultaneous. In particular say we have an observer who sees an event A happening at time 0, and a second event (call it B) at time t and the distance between them is greater than c t. Then you can find observers who see A happening first, B happening first or the two happening at the same time. However all observers will agree that the distance between the events was greater than c times the time between them. This seems like it would cause problems with causality, but it doesn't because we need the distance to be greater than c times the time, which means no lightspeed signal could get from A to B. If you allow ftl communication then this \"escape\" doesn't work anymore, and causality can be explicitly broken.    reply           eigenket  1 day ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Its probably mostly because you have an intuitive idea that there is some concept of \"now\" which is independent of the observer.

Time flows differently depending on velocity with respect to your frame of reference. Two observers moving at different speeds with respect to each other see different time flows. At normal speeds this is negligible but at close to light speed... hoo boy. You get things like observers seeing events occur separately that occured simultaneously for their counterparts and so forth. So if you were able to send information faster than light somehow, you would be sending it from one frame of reference with one notion of time into another frame of reference with a different notion of time -- one which observes receipt of the message before it can observe the sender sending it!
