I know everyone is telling you to use a old phone, but I am sure that you can find a device to suit your needs. Good luck!<p>(If you are handy, you can also use an old phone, open it up, and physically destroy the antennas, although this might hurt the battery life if the firmware decides to crank up the transmission power to maximum, if it cannot &quot;see&quot; any networks or towers).<p>But for maximum street cred, I&#x27;d go with two devices: a &#x27;vintage&#x27; mp3 player and a &#x27;vintage&#x27; or rugged GPS receiver. The more obscure the better. Those things are cool now!<p>Edit: The Garmin iQue were also Palm PDAs that had a GPS receiver and a headphone jack. They also look pretty rad and turn-of-the-century :) But remember, at some point children establish their own tastes and identities partially defined &#x2F;against&#x2F; their parents, so just because you might think that something is cool doesn&#x27;t mean that they would.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41533787&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41486352%2341533787\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41533608'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='0'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41533608' href='vote?id=41533608&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41486352'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=Kirby64\" class=\"hnuser\">Kirby64</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-13T18:07:53.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41533608\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41533608\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533787\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41533738\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41533608\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Do you want to track your kid, or give them access to maps?

On top of that I think your kid will enjoy wireless more than wired.<p>Otherwise I’d recommend an iPod touch, or any old smartphone.

I know everyone is telling you to use a old phone, but I am sure that you can find a device to suit your needs. Good luck!<p>(If you are handy, you can also use an old phone, open it up, and physically destroy the antennas, although this might hurt the battery life if the firmware decides to crank up the transmission power to maximum, if it cannot &quot;see&quot; any networks or towers).<p>But for maximum street cred, I&#x27;d go with two devices: a &#x27;vintage&#x27; mp3 player and a &#x27;vintage&#x27; or rugged GPS receiver. The more obscure the better. Those things are cool now!<p>Edit: The Garmin iQue were also Palm PDAs that had a GPS receiver and a headphone jack. They also look pretty rad and turn-of-the-century :) But remember, at some point children establish their own tastes and identities partially defined &#x2F;against&#x2F; their parents, so just because you might think that something is cool doesn&#x27;t mean that they would.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41533787&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41486352%2341533787\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41533608'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='0'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41533608' href='vote?id=41533608&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41486352'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=Kirby64\" class=\"hnuser\">Kirby64</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-13T18:07:53.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41533608\">1 day ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41533608\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41533787\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41533738\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41533608\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Do you want to track your kid, or give them access to maps?

On top of that I think your kid will enjoy wireless more than wired.<p>Otherwise I’d recommend an iPod touch, or any old smartphone.

If all you need is offline music and GPS with maps, an old smartphone without a SIM card is the best option. If you need internet connectivity, an old smartphone is probably still the best option, but with a SIM card. Just lock it down if you're worried about various apps. Another option would be to buy one of the dedicated kid s̶p̶y̶i̶n̶g̶  tracking devices and tape it to an iPod.    reply            pimlottc  1 day ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      AirTags are tied to your Apple ID, not to any particular device.    reply            jeroenhd  1 day ago    | prev | next  [–]      I don't know about the wired headphones, but maybe some cheap WiFi only smart watch will do?

I was hoping to avoid all the rest of the phone functionality.    reply            afiodorov  1 day ago    | prev | next  [–]      probably not the answer you’re looking for but iPads match the description (usb-c headphones for the newer models)    reply            dangus  1 day ago    | prev | next  [–]      Any reason for the wired headphone requirement besides resistance to change? Because you should be able to find a good quality pair for well under $50, and that would open up your device options to a wide array of smart watches. On top of that I think your kid will enjoy wireless more than wired. Otherwise I’d recommend an iPod touch, or any old smartphone. Just set them up with mobile device management so that you can lock out any features you don’t want your kid using. You can even activate the cellular and keep it quite locked down.

If all you need is offline music and GPS with maps, an old smartphone without a SIM card is the best option.

On top of that I think your kid will enjoy wireless more than wired. Otherwise I’d recommend an iPod touch, or any old smartphone. Just set them up with mobile device management so that you can lock out any features you don’t want your kid using. You can even activate the cellular and keep it quite locked down.

Since we used the iPad at home it worked for us to just enter our position once manually.    reply            afiodorov  16 hours ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      No, all of them do    reply            eternityforest  1 day ago    | prev | next  [–]      Don't they have flip phones that do that?

Because you should be able to find a good quality pair for well under $50, and that would open up your device options to a wide array of smart watches. On top of that I think your kid will enjoy wireless more than wired. Otherwise I’d recommend an iPod touch, or any old smartphone. Just set them up with mobile device management so that you can lock out any features you don’t want your kid using. You can even activate the cellular and keep it quite locked down. You could restrict basically everything: apps, web browsing, calls, texts, etc.    reply            andrepd  1 day ago    | prev | next  [–]      Qin F21/F22    reply            fsflover  1 day ago    | prev | next  [–]      You can very easily physically remove the modem and WiFi card from Librem 5 (those are on M.2 cards).

I know everyone is telling you to use a old phone, but I am sure that you can find a device to suit your needs. Good luck! (If you are handy, you can also use an old phone, open it up, and physically destroy the antennas, although this might hurt the battery life if the firmware decides to crank up the transmission power to maximum, if it cannot \"see\" any networks or towers). But for maximum street cred, I'd go with two devices: a 'vintage' mp3 player and a 'vintage' or rugged GPS receiver. The more obscure the better. Those things are cool now!

Because you should be able to find a good quality pair for well under $50, and that would open up your device options to a wide array of smart watches. On top of that I think your kid will enjoy wireless more than wired. Otherwise I’d recommend an iPod touch, or any old smartphone. Just set them up with mobile device management so that you can lock out any features you don’t want your kid using. You can even activate the cellular and keep it quite locked down.
