PIX is DirectX only, and everything else is vendor specific. I don't really know why you wouldn't just use your vendor's tooling though. The only thing I use RenderDoc for is I find debugging with it a bit easier than NSight when I need to find a problem, but for anything performance related I use  NSight (and would use PIX as well if Nvidia didn't gimp it). Oh also Intel's IGA I've found to be very buggy as well, so I avoid that.    reply    jms55  23 hours ago    | parent | next  [–]     jms55  23 hours ago    | parent | next  [–]    jms55 23 hours ago 23 hours ago | parent | next  [–]   parent next [–]  Just RenderDoc really.
