Therefore, I think any therapies should not be conducted on minors.</p>\n</div>\n</div></form><ul class=\"flat-list buttons\"><li class=\"first\"><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1fiy4a6/eu_to_pursue_ban_on_conversion_therapy_in_new/lnl9kmw/\" data-event-action=\"permalink\" class=\"bylink\" rel=\"nofollow\" >permalink</a></li><li><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-comment=\"/r/worldnews/comments/1fiy4a6/eu_to_pursue_ban_on_conversion_therapy_in_new/lnl9kmw/\" data-media=\"www.redditmedia.com\" data-link=\"/r/worldnews/comments/1fiy4a6/eu_to_pursue_ban_on_conversion_therapy_in_new/\" data-root=\"false\" data-title=\"EU to Pursue Ban on Conversion Therapy in New LGBTQ Strategy\" class=\"embed-comment\" >embed</a></li><li class=\"comment-save-button save-button login-required\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\">save</a></li><li><a href=\"#lnl77py\" data-event-action=\"parent\" class=\"bylink\" rel=\"nofollow\" >parent</a></li><li class=\"report-button login-required\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"reportbtn access-required\" data-event-action=\"report\">report</a></li><li class=\"reply-button login-required\"><a class=\"access-required\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-event-action=\"comment\" onclick=\"return reply(this)\">reply</a></li></ul><div class=\"reportform report-t1_lnl9kmw\"></div></div><div class=\"child\"><div id=\"siteTable_t1_lnl9kmw\" class=\"sitetable listing\"><div class=\" thing id-t1_lnlbjkl noncollapsed &#32; comment \" id=\"thing_t1_lnlbjkl\" onclick=\"click_thing(this)\" data-fullname=\"t1_lnlbjkl\" data-type=\"comment\" data-gildings=\"0\" data-subreddit=\"worldnews\" data-subreddit-prefixed=\"r/worldnews\" data-subreddit-fullname=\"t5_2qh13\" data-subreddit-type=\"public\" data-author=\"luxway\" data-author-fullname=\"t2_4gwit5nz\" data-replies=\"0\" data-permalink=\"/r/worldnews/comments/1fiy4a6/eu_to_pursue_ban_on_conversion_therapy_in_new/lnlbjkl/\" ><p class=\"parent\"><a name=\"lnlbjkl\"></a></p><div class=\"midcol unvoted\" ><div class=\"arrow up login-required access-required\" data-event-action=\"upvote\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"upvote\" tabindex=\"0\" ></div><div class=\"arrow down login-required access-required\" data-event-action=\"downvote\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"downvote\" tabindex=\"0\" ></div></div><div class=\"entry unvoted\"><p class=\"tagline\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand\" onclick=\"return togglecomment(this)\">[–]</a><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/luxway\" class=\"author may-blank id-t2_4gwit5nz\" >luxway</a><span class=\"userattrs\"></span>&#32;<span class=\"score dislikes\" title=\"8\">8 points</span><span class=\"score unvoted\" title=\"9\">9 points</span><span class=\"score likes\" title=\"10\">10 points</span>&#32;<time title=\"Tue Sep 17 16:22:41 2024 UTC\" datetime=\"2024-09-17T16:22:41+00:00\" class=\"live-timestamp\">3 hours ago</time>&nbsp;<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"numchildren\" onclick=\"return togglecomment(this)\">(0 children)</a></p><form action=\"#\" class=\"usertext warn-on-unload\" onsubmit=\"return post_form(this, 'editusertext')\" id=\"form-t1_lnlbjkl6ak\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"thing_id\" value=\"t1_lnlbjkl\"/><div class=\"usertext-body may-blank-within md-container \" ><div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>However, gender identity is not something that can be biologically discerned</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve known that its biological for decades though.

Its gender dysphoria not dysmorphia, dysmorphia is a mental illness that means you see your body incorrectly.  This is also the justification for bigotry and conversion therapy. Turns out its only \"a phase\" in about 1% of cases.  Theres also the issue where this is heavily discriminated against inside therapy. Therapy is not a safe place for queer people.   This matter is not something that you can easily discern by making biological tests   99% of the time, someone saying they are who they are, is accurate. That is more accurate than the avg diagnosis given by any medical practicioner for any condition.   However, outside of such cases, I do not think we should allow children to be subject to medical procedures that might be unnecessary, and they may deeply regret in the future. The story of John Money and Sex reassignment of David Reimer is exactly an example of what if we blindly trust sexologists.   The chance of someone regretting transition is 1%, the rate of regret if they are denied healthcare is 99%.  Forcing kids through the wrong puberty causes permanent lifelong damage.  Meanwhile most kids who \"regret transition\", only transition for a couple months before going back, as HRT is extremely obvious if it works or not. Given if you're not trans it will give you gender dysphoria as humans nbeed the correct level of hormones to function.  John Money believed gender identity didn't exist, his experiment on david reimer accidentally proved that gender identity was biological and very much real. His attempts to convert David Reimers gender identity failed. The fact you're bringing it up in order to argue against what its findings was is hypocritical.   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] Gosc101   3 points 4 points 5 points  3 hours ago *  (0 children)  I am aware, that current consensus is exactly the opposite of what John Money believed. I used him as an example that of how bad things can go when trusting the mental diagnosis of sexologist.  As for mixing, dysphoria and dysmorphia, it is my bad for using the wrong word (English is not my first language, which is rarely an issue, but it clearly can be when using medical terms).   99% of the time, someone saying they are who they are, is accurate. That is more accurate than the avg diagnosis given by any medical practitioner for any condition.   Forgive me for casting doubt on gathering such data. After all, I have seen scientific papers (not from medical field) that somehow got accepted despite being based on visibly bs data, including \"studies\" made by the people who already want to push the same point.  If you cite me a 99% success rate, I will have to press x to doubt. There are higher rates of mistakes in fields less arbitrary than one where you need to discern mental states of a minor. It is just not plausible.   permalink embed save parent report reply        [–] Gosc101   -1 points 0 points 1 point  3 hours ago  (1 child)  I suppose 99% could be true, when taking into account only people who made the decision to transition as adults after independent careful consideration.   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] luxway   1 point 2 points 3 points  2 hours ago  (0 children)  You mean, After being mutiliated and going throuhg the conversion therapy of enforced wrong puberty*  its not a decision. No-one would choose this if they could, because of the sheer amount of discrimination involved.  These kids deserve to be treated as human, not have their life destroyed by you just because you don't accept they exist and think they're sub human.  And no, the 99% holds true at all ages, obviously. Because people are born this way. Its not a \"choice\".   permalink embed save parent report reply                [+] [deleted]  5 hours ago  (27 children)  [removed]        [–] CosplaySteve   10 points 11 points 12 points  4 hours ago  (22 children)  I mean, you can’t really “convert” somebody’s sexuality.

I doubt that, in the end we are still animals, our natural purpose in life is to live, reproduce and die, our bodies have evolved and adapted to achieve that goal.

Of course, homosexuality is also normal in some cases, such as control/submission, for social gains or just by mistake (like a dog mounting another dog), but i'm not really talking about that.   permalink embed save parent report reply          [–] PistachioNSFW   3 points 4 points 5 points  2 hours ago  (0 children)  You can doubt anything you like, doesn’t make it logical.

When you learn about anatomy and physiology you also learn nearly no humans are the same. Generally the same. And not the same doesn’t mean unnatural when it’s literally natural because it happened naturally.   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] Ancient_Being0   -2 points -1 points 0 points  2 hours ago  (0 children)  Yes I think I am just using the wrong word to describe what I'm meaning because I do understand your point here.   permalink embed save parent report reply                      [–] Realistic_Swan_6801   8 points 9 points 10 points  3 hours ago  (3 children)  It’s banned because it’s not medicine, even if you don’t think it’s immoral, the therapies fundamentally don’t work, you can’t change your sexual orientation even if you want to. We don’t let medical professional use dangerous, ineffective therapy’s  shown to hurt patients.   permalink embed save report reply     [+] Ancient_Being0   comment score below threshold -6 points -5 points -4 points  3 hours ago  (2 children)  That argument makes no sense, we don't ban things because they don't meet certain criteria for medicine.. see homeopathy, eastern medicine, etc.  This is such a common misunderstanding that I see everywhere, but we simply do not know enough about sexuality to make the assertion that we cannot change our sexualities. Again, I see protecting the vulnerable, but why should a willing adult not be able to engage in it?   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] Realistic_Swan_6801   7 points 8 points 9 points  3 hours ago  (1 child)  Those aren’t done by licensed medical professionals, therapy is. Therapists, psychologists, and doctors all have licensing requirements. Also most of those forms of quackery are not harmful just useless, if a eastern medicine practitioner tried to claim they could cure cancer and discourage treatment they probably could be criminally charged or at least sued at a minimum depending on the country.   permalink embed save parent report reply                [–] Turban_Legend8985   [score hidden]  47 minutes ago  (1 child)  EU can't ban anything because it is not a country but just a union compiled of independent countries and these countries don't really have to really give a damn what EU wants. For example, conversion therapy has been subject for conversations here in Finland recently but it is still legal and it still will be legal because right-wing government supports it.   permalink embed save report reply     [–] vkstu   [score hidden]  6 minutes ago  (0 children)  What are you on about? The European Commission can propose laws and those laws, if accepted, have to be implemented by its constituent countries (they can make their laws more stringent than EU law though, but not less). The point being is that every country has a chance to veto it, or change it, during a meeting in the European Council or Council of Ministers.  So unless a country vetos it, the EU very much can seek to 'pursue a ban' and make it work. For that matter, 'pursue' doesn't mean it'll become so, it's merely that the commission will strive towards it (succesfully or not).   permalink embed save parent report reply       about blog  about  advertising  careers help site rules  Reddit help center  reddiquette  mod guidelines  contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone  Reddit for Android  mobile website <3 reddit premium Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2024 reddit inc.

Not even once.   permalink embed save parent report reply            [–] mothrageddon   18 points 19 points 20 points  4 hours ago  (5 children)  Luckily gender dysphoria is recognized as a medical condition whose patients deserve respect, dignity and treatment according to pretty much every major health organization.  https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-states-stop-interfering-health-care-transgender-children  https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2021/03/health-care-for-transgender-and-gender-diverse-individuals  https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2024/02/policy-supporting-transgender-nonbinary  https://pedsendo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Pediatric-Endocrine-Society-Statement-TG.pdf   permalink embed save report reply     [+] [deleted]  3 hours ago *  (4 children)  [removed]        [–] luxway   4 points 5 points 6 points  3 hours ago  (3 children)   The issue is whether a child is just having a phase, other mental condition, particular doctor has misguided ideas, or whether they really have gender dysmorphia.   Its gender dysphoria not dysmorphia, dysmorphia is a mental illness that means you see your body incorrectly.  This is also the justification for bigotry and conversion therapy. Turns out its only \"a phase\" in about 1% of cases.  Theres also the issue where this is heavily discriminated against inside therapy. Therapy is not a safe place for queer people.   This matter is not something that you can easily discern by making biological tests   99% of the time, someone saying they are who they are, is accurate. That is more accurate than the avg diagnosis given by any medical practicioner for any condition.   However, outside of such cases, I do not think we should allow children to be subject to medical procedures that might be unnecessary, and they may deeply regret in the future. The story of John Money and Sex reassignment of David Reimer is exactly an example of what if we blindly trust sexologists.   The chance of someone regretting transition is 1%, the rate of regret if they are denied healthcare is 99%.  Forcing kids through the wrong puberty causes permanent lifelong damage.  Meanwhile most kids who \"regret transition\", only transition for a couple months before going back, as HRT is extremely obvious if it works or not. Given if you're not trans it will give you gender dysphoria as humans nbeed the correct level of hormones to function.  John Money believed gender identity didn't exist, his experiment on david reimer accidentally proved that gender identity was biological and very much real. His attempts to convert David Reimers gender identity failed. The fact you're bringing it up in order to argue against what its findings was is hypocritical.   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] Gosc101   3 points 4 points 5 points  3 hours ago *  (0 children)  I am aware, that current consensus is exactly the opposite of what John Money believed. I used him as an example that of how bad things can go when trusting the mental diagnosis of sexologist.  As for mixing, dysphoria and dysmorphia, it is my bad for using the wrong word (English is not my first language, which is rarely an issue, but it clearly can be when using medical terms).   99% of the time, someone saying they are who they are, is accurate. That is more accurate than the avg diagnosis given by any medical practitioner for any condition.   Forgive me for casting doubt on gathering such data. After all, I have seen scientific papers (not from medical field) that somehow got accepted despite being based on visibly bs data, including \"studies\" made by the people who already want to push the same point.  If you cite me a 99% success rate, I will have to press x to doubt. There are higher rates of mistakes in fields less arbitrary than one where you need to discern mental states of a minor. It is just not plausible.   permalink embed save parent report reply        [–] Gosc101   -1 points 0 points 1 point  3 hours ago  (1 child)  I suppose 99% could be true, when taking into account only people who made the decision to transition as adults after independent careful consideration.   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] luxway   1 point 2 points 3 points  2 hours ago  (0 children)  You mean, After being mutiliated and going throuhg the conversion therapy of enforced wrong puberty*  its not a decision. No-one would choose this if they could, because of the sheer amount of discrimination involved.  These kids deserve to be treated as human, not have their life destroyed by you just because you don't accept they exist and think they're sub human.  And no, the 99% holds true at all ages, obviously. Because people are born this way. Its not a \"choice\".   permalink embed save parent report reply                [+] [deleted]  5 hours ago  (27 children)  [removed]        [–] CosplaySteve   10 points 11 points 12 points  4 hours ago  (22 children)  I mean, you can’t really “convert” somebody’s sexuality. Speaking as a straight dude, no amount of therapy is gonna make me like men. Expecting it to work the other way around is ridiculous. “Therapy” like that is only gonna make people hate themselves for things they can’t control.   permalink embed save report reply     [+] Ancient_Being0   comment score below threshold -23 points -22 points -21 points  4 hours ago  (21 children)  That is a pretty big assertion given how little we know of sexuality.. you may think that no amount of therapy will do anything for your sexuality, but we simply don't know.. it is also different when you are proceeding from the natural to unnatural rather than gay to straight..   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] PistachioNSFW   10 points 11 points 12 points  3 hours ago  (20 children)  Or being gay is natural and it’s exactly the same.

I doubt that, in the end we are still animals, our natural purpose in life is to live, reproduce and die, our bodies have evolved and adapted to achieve that goal.  One can be gay for sure, since we are not only animals nowadays (we have intelligence and strong emotions) and freedom of choice exists (in some places), but i doubt it's something natural in our species.   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] Lyskir   8 points 9 points 10 points  3 hours ago  (1 child)  homosexuality occures in many species, it is natural   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] RockstepGuy   -1 points 0 points 1 point  2 hours ago  (0 children)  Yes, but in most cases those are not really the norm but rather an anomaly, in only a very few number of species is homosexuality something that happens \"often\" and were homosexuality becomes \"locked\", humans and domesticated sheeps.  Of course, homosexuality is also normal in some cases, such as control/submission, for social gains or just by mistake (like a dog mounting another dog), but i'm not really talking about that.   permalink embed save parent report reply          [–] PistachioNSFW   3 points 4 points 5 points  2 hours ago  (0 children)  You can doubt anything you like, doesn’t make it logical.

This has it remaining as unnatural, just as 6 toes, 3 fingers, or other deformities which can take place are. Not everyone is gay, no.   permalink embed save parent report reply    continue this thread             [–] PistachioNSFW   0 points 1 point 2 points  2 hours ago  (1 child)  You seem stuck on natural meaning the majority. When you learn about anatomy and physiology you also learn nearly no humans are the same. Generally the same. And not the same doesn’t mean unnatural when it’s literally natural because it happened naturally.   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] Ancient_Being0   -2 points -1 points 0 points  2 hours ago  (0 children)  Yes I think I am just using the wrong word to describe what I'm meaning because I do understand your point here.   permalink embed save parent report reply                      [–] Realistic_Swan_6801   8 points 9 points 10 points  3 hours ago  (3 children)  It’s banned because it’s not medicine, even if you don’t think it’s immoral, the therapies fundamentally don’t work, you can’t change your sexual orientation even if you want to. We don’t let medical professional use dangerous, ineffective therapy’s  shown to hurt patients.   permalink embed save report reply     [+] Ancient_Being0   comment score below threshold -6 points -5 points -4 points  3 hours ago  (2 children)  That argument makes no sense, we don't ban things because they don't meet certain criteria for medicine.. see homeopathy, eastern medicine, etc.  This is such a common misunderstanding that I see everywhere, but we simply do not know enough about sexuality to make the assertion that we cannot change our sexualities. Again, I see protecting the vulnerable, but why should a willing adult not be able to engage in it?   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] Realistic_Swan_6801   7 points 8 points 9 points  3 hours ago  (1 child)  Those aren’t done by licensed medical professionals, therapy is. Therapists, psychologists, and doctors all have licensing requirements. Also most of those forms of quackery are not harmful just useless, if a eastern medicine practitioner tried to claim they could cure cancer and discourage treatment they probably could be criminally charged or at least sued at a minimum depending on the country.   permalink embed save parent report reply                [–] Turban_Legend8985   [score hidden]  47 minutes ago  (1 child)  EU can't ban anything because it is not a country but just a union compiled of independent countries and these countries don't really have to really give a damn what EU wants. For example, conversion therapy has been subject for conversations here in Finland recently but it is still legal and it still will be legal because right-wing government supports it.   permalink embed save report reply     [–] vkstu   [score hidden]  6 minutes ago  (0 children)  What are you on about? The European Commission can propose laws and those laws, if accepted, have to be implemented by its constituent countries (they can make their laws more stringent than EU law though, but not less). The point being is that every country has a chance to veto it, or change it, during a meeting in the European Council or Council of Ministers.  So unless a country vetos it, the EU very much can seek to 'pursue a ban' and make it work. For that matter, 'pursue' doesn't mean it'll become so, it's merely that the commission will strive towards it (succesfully or not).   permalink embed save parent report reply       about blog  about  advertising  careers help site rules  Reddit help center  reddiquette  mod guidelines  contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone  Reddit for Android  mobile website <3 reddit premium Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2024 reddit inc.

The EU is following in the path of countries including Ireland and the UK, which have moved to ban conversion therapy, the controversial practice of trying to change an LGBTQ child’s sexual orientation or gender identity through counseling. The issue has also become a politicized fight in the US — where similar bans have been subject to lawsuits, including ones that have been appealed to the Supreme Court.  Kim van Sparrentak, a lawmaker and co-president of the European Parliament’s LGBTIQ+ intergroup, welcomed the EU’s move. “I can’t wait until our community is protected from these torturous practices,” van Sparrentak said. “We are not sick, and we do not need to be fixed.”   permalink embed save report reply     [–] luxway   4 points 5 points 6 points  3 hours ago  (2 children)   The EU is following in the path of countries including Ireland and the UK , which have moved to ban conversion therapy   News to us here in the UK.

Sex change surgery isn’t usually performed on minors at all,  but hormones or puberty blockers are sometimes given, those are sex therapies not gender therapies   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] Gosc101   -2 points -1 points 0 points  3 hours ago  (1 child)  I suppose you are right, and I have amended my comment.  Sex change surgeries serve to change sex to match one's gender identity. However, gender identity is not something that can be biologically discerned. This about the mental state, and minors can easily change their minds throughout their life and are also susceptible to influence of adults. Therefore, I think any therapies should not be conducted on minors.   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] luxway   8 points 9 points 10 points  3 hours ago  (0 children)   However, gender identity is not something that can be biologically discerned   We've known that its biological for decades though. Do you mean you want a biological test? but thats extre3mely expensive and unneeded. We alreayd know someone saying who they are is 99% accurate which is astounding in medicine.   and minors can easily change their minds throughout their life and are also susceptible to influence of adults.   Despite this theory, conversion therapy has never been proven to work. Not even once.   permalink embed save parent report reply            [–] mothrageddon   18 points 19 points 20 points  4 hours ago  (5 children)  Luckily gender dysphoria is recognized as a medical condition whose patients deserve respect, dignity and treatment according to pretty much every major health organization.  https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-states-stop-interfering-health-care-transgender-children  https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2021/03/health-care-for-transgender-and-gender-diverse-individuals  https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2024/02/policy-supporting-transgender-nonbinary  https://pedsendo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Pediatric-Endocrine-Society-Statement-TG.pdf   permalink embed save report reply     [+] [deleted]  3 hours ago *  (4 children)  [removed]        [–] luxway   4 points 5 points 6 points  3 hours ago  (3 children)   The issue is whether a child is just having a phase, other mental condition, particular doctor has misguided ideas, or whether they really have gender dysmorphia.   Its gender dysphoria not dysmorphia, dysmorphia is a mental illness that means you see your body incorrectly.  This is also the justification for bigotry and conversion therapy. Turns out its only \"a phase\" in about 1% of cases.  Theres also the issue where this is heavily discriminated against inside therapy. Therapy is not a safe place for queer people.   This matter is not something that you can easily discern by making biological tests   99% of the time, someone saying they are who they are, is accurate. That is more accurate than the avg diagnosis given by any medical practicioner for any condition.   However, outside of such cases, I do not think we should allow children to be subject to medical procedures that might be unnecessary, and they may deeply regret in the future. The story of John Money and Sex reassignment of David Reimer is exactly an example of what if we blindly trust sexologists.   The chance of someone regretting transition is 1%, the rate of regret if they are denied healthcare is 99%.  Forcing kids through the wrong puberty causes permanent lifelong damage.  Meanwhile most kids who \"regret transition\", only transition for a couple months before going back, as HRT is extremely obvious if it works or not.

I used him as an example that of how bad things can go when trusting the mental diagnosis of sexologist.  As for mixing, dysphoria and dysmorphia, it is my bad for using the wrong word (English is not my first language, which is rarely an issue, but it clearly can be when using medical terms).   99% of the time, someone saying they are who they are, is accurate. That is more accurate than the avg diagnosis given by any medical practitioner for any condition.   Forgive me for casting doubt on gathering such data. After all, I have seen scientific papers (not from medical field) that somehow got accepted despite being based on visibly bs data, including \"studies\" made by the people who already want to push the same point.

The European Commission can propose laws and those laws, if accepted, have to be implemented by its constituent countries (they can make their laws more stringent than EU law though, but not less). The point being is that every country has a chance to veto it, or change it, during a meeting in the European Council or Council of Ministers.  So unless a country vetos it, the EU very much can seek to 'pursue a ban' and make it work. For that matter, 'pursue' doesn't mean it'll become so, it's merely that the commission will strive towards it (succesfully or not).   permalink embed save parent report reply       Welcome to Reddit, the front page of the internet.

Its gender dysphoria not dysmorphia, dysmorphia is a mental illness that means you see your body incorrectly.  This is also the justification for bigotry and conversion therapy. Turns out its only \"a phase\" in about 1% of cases.  Theres also the issue where this is heavily discriminated against inside therapy. Therapy is not a safe place for queer people.   This matter is not something that you can easily discern by making biological tests   99% of the time, someone saying they are who they are, is accurate. That is more accurate than the avg diagnosis given by any medical practicioner for any condition.   However, outside of such cases, I do not think we should allow children to be subject to medical procedures that might be unnecessary, and they may deeply regret in the future. The story of John Money and Sex reassignment of David Reimer is exactly an example of what if we blindly trust sexologists.   The chance of someone regretting transition is 1%, the rate of regret if they are denied healthcare is 99%.  Forcing kids through the wrong puberty causes permanent lifelong damage.  Meanwhile most kids who \"regret transition\", only transition for a couple months before going back, as HRT is extremely obvious if it works or not. Given if you're not trans it will give you gender dysphoria as humans nbeed the correct level of hormones to function.  John Money believed gender identity didn't exist, his experiment on david reimer accidentally proved that gender identity was biological and very much real.

Sex change surgery isn’t usually performed on minors at all,  but hormones or puberty blockers are sometimes given, those are sex therapies not gender therapies   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] Gosc101   -2 points -1 points 0 points  3 hours ago  (1 child)  I suppose you are right, and I have amended my comment.  Sex change surgeries serve to change sex to match one's gender identity. However, gender identity is not something that can be biologically discerned. This about the mental state, and minors can easily change their minds throughout their life and are also susceptible to influence of adults. Therefore, I think any therapies should not be conducted on minors.   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] luxway   8 points 9 points 10 points  3 hours ago  (0 children)   However, gender identity is not something that can be biologically discerned   We've known that its biological for decades though. Do you mean you want a biological test? but thats extre3mely expensive and unneeded. We alreayd know someone saying who they are is 99% accurate which is astounding in medicine.   and minors can easily change their minds throughout their life and are also susceptible to influence of adults.

Its gender dysphoria not dysmorphia, dysmorphia is a mental illness that means you see your body incorrectly.  This is also the justification for bigotry and conversion therapy. Turns out its only \"a phase\" in about 1% of cases.  Theres also the issue where this is heavily discriminated against inside therapy. Therapy is not a safe place for queer people.   This matter is not something that you can easily discern by making biological tests   99% of the time, someone saying they are who they are, is accurate. That is more accurate than the avg diagnosis given by any medical practicioner for any condition.   However, outside of such cases, I do not think we should allow children to be subject to medical procedures that might be unnecessary, and they may deeply regret in the future. The story of John Money and Sex reassignment of David Reimer is exactly an example of what if we blindly trust sexologists.   The chance of someone regretting transition is 1%, the rate of regret if they are denied healthcare is 99%.  Forcing kids through the wrong puberty causes permanent lifelong damage.  Meanwhile most kids who \"regret transition\", only transition for a couple months before going back, as HRT is extremely obvious if it works or not. Given if you're not trans it will give you gender dysphoria as humans nbeed the correct level of hormones to function.  John Money believed gender identity didn't exist, his experiment on david reimer accidentally proved that gender identity was biological and very much real. His attempts to convert David Reimers gender identity failed. The fact you're bringing it up in order to argue against what its findings was is hypocritical.   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] Gosc101   3 points 4 points 5 points  3 hours ago *  (0 children)  I am aware, that current consensus is exactly the opposite of what John Money believed. I used him as an example that of how bad things can go when trusting the mental diagnosis of sexologist.  As for mixing, dysphoria and dysmorphia, it is my bad for using the wrong word (English is not my first language, which is rarely an issue, but it clearly can be when using medical terms).   99% of the time, someone saying they are who they are, is accurate. That is more accurate than the avg diagnosis given by any medical practitioner for any condition.   Forgive me for casting doubt on gathering such data. After all, I have seen scientific papers (not from medical field) that somehow got accepted despite being based on visibly bs data, including \"studies\" made by the people who already want to push the same point.  If you cite me a 99% success rate, I will have to press x to doubt. There are higher rates of mistakes in fields less arbitrary than one where you need to discern mental states of a minor. It is just not plausible.   permalink embed save parent report reply        [–] Gosc101   -1 points 0 points 1 point  3 hours ago  (1 child)  I suppose 99% could be true, when taking into account only people who made the decision to transition as adults after independent careful consideration.   permalink embed save parent report reply     [–] luxway   1 point 2 points 3 points  2 hours ago  (0 children)  You mean, After being mutiliated and going throuhg the conversion therapy of enforced wrong puberty*  its not a decision. No-one would choose this if they could, because of the sheer amount of discrimination involved.  These kids deserve to be treated as human, not have their life destroyed by you just because you don't accept they exist and think they're sub human.  And no, the 99% holds true at all ages, obviously. Because people are born this way.

Also most of those forms of quackery are not harmful just useless, if a eastern medicine practitioner tried to claim they could cure cancer and discourage treatment they probably could be criminally charged or at least sued at a minimum depending on the country.   permalink embed save parent report reply                [–] Turban_Legend8985   [score hidden]  47 minutes ago  (1 child)  EU can't ban anything because it is not a country but just a union compiled of independent countries and these countries don't really have to really give a damn what EU wants.

The European Commission can propose laws and those laws, if accepted, have to be implemented by its constituent countries (they can make their laws more stringent than EU law though, but not less). The point being is that every country has a chance to veto it, or change it, during a meeting in the European Council or Council of Ministers.  So unless a country vetos it, the EU very much can seek to 'pursue a ban' and make it work. For that matter, 'pursue' doesn't mean it'll become so, it's merely that the commission will strive towards it (succesfully or not).   permalink embed save parent report reply          [–] BubsyFanboy   73 points 74 points 75 points  6 hours ago  (2 children)  Wait, it wasn't banned before?

Its gender dysphoria not dysmorphia, dysmorphia is a mental illness that means you see your body incorrectly.  This is also the justification for bigotry and conversion therapy. Turns out its only \"a phase\" in about 1% of cases.  Theres also the issue where this is heavily discriminated against inside therapy. Therapy is not a safe place for queer people.   This matter is not something that you can easily discern by making biological tests   99% of the time, someone saying they are who they are, is accurate. That is more accurate than the avg diagnosis given by any medical practicioner for any condition.   However, outside of such cases, I do not think we should allow children to be subject to medical procedures that might be unnecessary, and they may deeply regret in the future. The story of John Money and Sex reassignment of David Reimer is exactly an example of what if we blindly trust sexologists.   The chance of someone regretting transition is 1%, the rate of regret if they are denied healthcare is 99%.  Forcing kids through the wrong puberty causes permanent lifelong damage.  Meanwhile most kids who \"regret transition\", only transition for a couple months before going back, as HRT is extremely obvious if it works or not. Given if you're not trans it will give you gender dysphoria as humans nbeed the correct level of hormones to function.  John Money believed gender identity didn't exist, his experiment on david reimer accidentally proved that gender identity was biological and very much real. His attempts to convert David Reimers gender identity failed.

As for mixing, dysphoria and dysmorphia, it is my bad for using the wrong word (English is not my first language, which is rarely an issue, but it clearly can be when using medical terms).   99% of the time, someone saying they are who they are, is accurate. That is more accurate than the avg diagnosis given by any medical practitioner for any condition.   Forgive me for casting doubt on gathering such data.
