I&#x27;m just not convinced in this case. Just looking at the picture it seems neither innocuous nor particularly transparent even thought it&#x27;s on glass. Maybe they can make the connections less apparent without exposed coax, and maybe they won&#x27;t need to add (extra) windows on top of windows, and maybe they can make the conductive areas more transparent, but this is only useful as a proof of concept.<p>Let&#x27;s see what they can do for a commercial product. Usually, there are tens of antennas on a single tower so they can&#x27;t all look like this. Also, I&#x27;m going to assume that you have to keep anyone from getting within 3 meters just due to radiated emissions, so don&#x27;t go just looking out that window!</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41592879&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341592879\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41594221'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41594221' href='vote?id=41594221&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=avianlyric\" class=\"hnuser\">avianlyric</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T17:31:24.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41594221\">5 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41594221\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592879\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41592938\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41594221\" n=\"2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">This is a commercial product, that’s actually been installed and being used. The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass.<p>Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem.<p>This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the <i>inside</i> of a buildings facade, while providing coverage <i>outside</i> the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna.<p>To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ranplanwireless.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;resources&#x2F;low-e-glass&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ranplanwireless.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;resources&#x2F;low-e-glass&#x2F;</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41594221&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341594221\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41594616'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='2'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"80\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41594616' href='vote?id=41594616&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px;

There are a lot of places in the building where slightly darkened glass panel would not look too out of place, as opposed to a bulky ugly opaque plastic box. Especially if architects really work on integrating it, it can be made very unobtrusive without needing 100% transparency. And, in a lot of buildings there are glass panels which aren&#x27;t within the foot traffic areas - high windows, ceilings, technical areas, etc.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593569&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593569\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41596137'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41596137' href='vote?id=41596137&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=Reason077\" class=\"hnuser\">Reason077</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T20:35:48.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41596137\">2 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41596137\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592879\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593569\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41595510\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41596137\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; <i>“Usually, there are tens of antennas on a single tower so they can&#x27;t all look like this.

How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it<p>That was my first takeaway from the photo from outside. The kinds of antennas they put on top of buildings routinely run many hundreds to a thousand watts or more of power directionally out into the city. That&#x27;s fine when you&#x27;re putting it on equipment outside the building on a controlled access roof pointing away from the occupants in the building. Everyone actually in the beam pattern is going to be far away from the active elements.<p>This design doesn&#x27;t seem to be incredibly directional especially outwards. You&#x27;re not going to be able to run much power on that antenna, and now you&#x27;re going to have it on the inside of metallized glass. A lot of that energy is going to stay in the building. I wouldn&#x27;t want the desk next to this if it&#x27;s going to run even 100W.

Many others have done this as well over many years, and have either pivoted (Meraki) or gone out of business and sold their assets to conventional ISPs (Common Networks).<p>The biggest hurdle is that reliably running high performance transmitters is not easy for amateurs, and the payoff for any one transmitter is not that much. I&#x27;m going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The &quot;meshier&quot; the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem.<p>Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node.<p>The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593722&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593722\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593214'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593214' href='vote?id=41593214&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=vel0city\" class=\"hnuser\">vel0city</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T15:58:59.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593214\">6 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593214\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592907\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593722\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41593326\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593214\" n=\"3\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Is it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not.<p>Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there&#x27;s no centralized management. 5GHz&#x2F;6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz&#x2F;900MHz&#x2F;1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies.<p>Then we&#x27;re not only going to saturate the bands with people doing whatever they want (within legal limits), we&#x27;re going to depend on mesh routing through all that noise?

Oh, <i>you</i> get to decide how to operate the mesh but I can&#x27;t? I guess you&#x27;ll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh.<p>You&#x27;ll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx&#x2F;rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage. You&#x27;ll start encouraging people to not put up more nodes in a certain area because it&#x27;s just getting too crowded here, but hey we need to incentivize someone to set up a node on the other side of town.<p>Snap now it seems like we&#x27;re running a regular carrier.<p>I participate and use city-sized WiFi mesh networks in the amateur radio world. They&#x27;re not anywhere near a replacement for what normal people think of as internet connectivity.

There is a volunteer-driven LoRaWAN Helium[0] mesh network which added 5G some 2 years back. But it&#x27;s cryptocurrency-driven and apparently unprofitable for volunteers investing in radios and antennas. At least where I live.<p>My neighbor still has the Helium antenna and radio on his balcony but it&#x27;s offline due to costs&#x2F;profits disproportion. It&#x27;s the LoRaWAN, pre-5G hardware though, and I don&#x27;t know anyone running the 5G version, if it&#x27;s even a real thing. I liked the idea from technical perspective but the project itself was off-putting for me due to being built around a crypto token and having overall web3 smell.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Helium_Network\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Helium_Network</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593526&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593526\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41594123'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41594123' href='vote?id=41594123&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=ianburrell\" class=\"hnuser\">ianburrell</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T17:20:51.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41594123\">5 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41594123\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592907\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593526\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41593134\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41594123\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">There are a few problems with this. Mesh is cool for other uses but can&#x27;t replace the infrastructure of mobile operator.<p>One, what frequency are you going to use? If you use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, your Wifi-using neighbors will hate you. There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum.<p>Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city. Also, 5G routers are not that cheap. It also means that there will be no reception away from the city. Most routers are meant to be used inside, and good coverage, requires mounting them outside on a pole.<p>Three, I&#x27;m not sure there is 5G device-to-device. There was LTE-Direct but it never got implemented. There D2D in 5G spec but I can&#x27;t find any implementations.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41594123&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341594123\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593134'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593134' href='vote?id=41593134&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=foxyv\" class=\"hnuser\">foxyv</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T15:50:22.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593134\">7 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593134\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592907\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41594123\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41593462\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593134\" n=\"4\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Yes it is possible.

Do a fact-check there. ;) I think most diversity antenna systems that you describe use 2. And they are still considered “premium”. 3 is a bit overkill for FM, FM is very resilient against obstacles.<p>If I’m wrong, would be interesting to see an example of a car that uses 3 or more.

Since its antennas are on the outside it should get way better GPS and cellular connectivity than my phone in my pocket deep in a metal box.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41596738&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341596738\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                                    <tr class='athing comtr' id='41594126'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='0'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41594126' href='vote?id=41594126&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=sgt\" class=\"hnuser\">sgt</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T17:21:02.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41594126\">5 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41594126\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593519\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41595257\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41594126\" n=\"2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Won&#x27;t tapping on the glass disrupt the signal, or simply wind or heavy rain against it disrupt it as well?</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41594126&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341594126\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41596504'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41596504' href='vote?id=41596504&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=zonkerdonker\" class=\"hnuser\">zonkerdonker</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T21:22:23.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41596504\">1 hour ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41596504\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41594126\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41595257\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41596504\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">It would if this was actually mm-wave 5g.

TLDR, skeptical due to the issue of the two 5G frequency ranges.<p>&gt; Because 5G networks include spectrum comprising higher frequencies than 4G, base stations for 5G networks serve a smaller coverage footprint.<p>Sure<p>&gt; It [the window antenna] is compatible with frequencies in the 5G Sub6 band—meaning signals that are less than 6 gigahertz (GHz). Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum.<p>But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also <i>didn’t</i> have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps.<p>The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band.<p>I’m sure there’s some advantage to the 5G tech in general, because it is newer. But that’s a different pitch, right?</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593218&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593218\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593660'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593660' href='vote?id=41593660&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=toast0\" class=\"hnuser\">toast0</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T16:35:36.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593660\">6 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593660\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593218\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593268\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593660\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Sub6 is more or less the same frequencies as 4G. I know there&#x27;s more low frequency (additional spectrum formerly used for over the air TV), and there might be some slightly higher frequency too, but this is the general purpose stuff. The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train&#x2F;transit stations.<p>5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn&#x27;t have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised.<p>Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There&#x27;s plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there&#x27;s no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps. Which is why some antennas look like weird saguaro or palm trees and pine trees. It might be nice to have antennas in windows in office buildings instead hanging on the side, and it might be easier to install as well.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593660&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593660\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593268'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='0'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593268' href='vote?id=41593268&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=HumblyTossed\" class=\"hnuser\">HumblyTossed</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T16:03:25.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593268\">6 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593268\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593218\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41592963\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593268\" n=\"3\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">That&#x27;s not a glass antenna.

Maybe they can make the connections less apparent without exposed coax, and maybe they won&#x27;t need to add (extra) windows on top of windows, and maybe they can make the conductive areas more transparent, but this is only useful as a proof of concept.<p>Let&#x27;s see what they can do for a commercial product. Usually, there are tens of antennas on a single tower so they can&#x27;t all look like this.

The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass.<p>Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem.<p>This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the <i>inside</i> of a buildings facade, while providing coverage <i>outside</i> the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna.<p>To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ranplanwireless.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;resources&#x2F;low-e-glass&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ranplanwireless.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;resources&#x2F;low-e-glass&#x2F;</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41594221&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341594221\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41594616'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='2'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"80\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41594616' href='vote?id=41594616&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px;

How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it<p>That was my first takeaway from the photo from outside. The kinds of antennas they put on top of buildings routinely run many hundreds to a thousand watts or more of power directionally out into the city. That&#x27;s fine when you&#x27;re putting it on equipment outside the building on a controlled access roof pointing away from the occupants in the building. Everyone actually in the beam pattern is going to be far away from the active elements.<p>This design doesn&#x27;t seem to be incredibly directional especially outwards. You&#x27;re not going to be able to run much power on that antenna, and now you&#x27;re going to have it on the inside of metallized glass. A lot of that energy is going to stay in the building. I wouldn&#x27;t want the desk next to this if it&#x27;s going to run even 100W. Just asking to get some good RF burns.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593789&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593789\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41596303'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41596303' href='vote?id=41596303&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=Reason077\" class=\"hnuser\">Reason077</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T20:55:40.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41596303\">2 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41596303\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592879\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41593789\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593330\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41596303\" n=\"2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; <i>”A lot of that energy is going to stay in the building.”</i><p>Right.

Many others have done this as well over many years, and have either pivoted (Meraki) or gone out of business and sold their assets to conventional ISPs (Common Networks).<p>The biggest hurdle is that reliably running high performance transmitters is not easy for amateurs, and the payoff for any one transmitter is not that much. I&#x27;m going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The &quot;meshier&quot; the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem.<p>Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node.<p>The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593722&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593722\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593214'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593214' href='vote?id=41593214&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=vel0city\" class=\"hnuser\">vel0city</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T15:58:59.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593214\">6 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593214\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592907\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593722\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41593326\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593214\" n=\"3\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Is it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not.<p>Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there&#x27;s no centralized management. 5GHz&#x2F;6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz&#x2F;900MHz&#x2F;1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies.<p>Then we&#x27;re not only going to saturate the bands with people doing whatever they want (within legal limits), we&#x27;re going to depend on mesh routing through all that noise? There goes your reliability and efficiency of sending data.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593214&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593214\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593228'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='2'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"80\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593228' href='vote?id=41593228&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=throwaway48540\" class=\"hnuser\">throwaway48540</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T16:00:49.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593228\">6 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593228\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592907\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41593214\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593326\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593228\" n=\"2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">I&#x27;m talking about creating a single mesh network, not a Wifi-like situation with many networks on the same bands.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593228&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593228\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593247'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593247' href='vote?id=41593247&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=vel0city\" class=\"hnuser\">vel0city</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T16:02:19.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593247\">6 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593247\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592907\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41593228\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593326\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593247\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">There is no difference in the end.

Oh, <i>you</i> get to decide how to operate the mesh but I can&#x27;t? I guess you&#x27;ll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh.<p>You&#x27;ll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx&#x2F;rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage. You&#x27;ll start encouraging people to not put up more nodes in a certain area because it&#x27;s just getting too crowded here, but hey we need to incentivize someone to set up a node on the other side of town.<p>Snap now it seems like we&#x27;re running a regular carrier.<p>I participate and use city-sized WiFi mesh networks in the amateur radio world. They&#x27;re not anywhere near a replacement for what normal people think of as internet connectivity. I can&#x27;t imagine swapping WiFi for 5G cellular stacks would end up making a radical difference.

They better have properly grounded it as well and put fourth good lightning protection for this new wire high point at the top of their home.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593720&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593720\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593506'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='3'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593506' href='vote?id=41593506&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=vel0city\" class=\"hnuser\">vel0city</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T16:23:30.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593506\">6 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593506\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592907\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">root</a> | <a href=\"#41593351\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593529\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41593526\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593506\" n=\"5\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; If it&#x27;s part of every modem&#x2F;gateway router<p>That&#x27;s not really a &quot;mesh&quot; then.

There is a volunteer-driven LoRaWAN Helium[0] mesh network which added 5G some 2 years back. But it&#x27;s cryptocurrency-driven and apparently unprofitable for volunteers investing in radios and antennas. At least where I live.<p>My neighbor still has the Helium antenna and radio on his balcony but it&#x27;s offline due to costs&#x2F;profits disproportion. It&#x27;s the LoRaWAN, pre-5G hardware though, and I don&#x27;t know anyone running the 5G version, if it&#x27;s even a real thing. I liked the idea from technical perspective but the project itself was off-putting for me due to being built around a crypto token and having overall web3 smell.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Helium_Network\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Helium_Network</a></div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593526&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593526\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n            <tr class='athing comtr' id='41594123'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41594123' href='vote?id=41594123&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=ianburrell\" class=\"hnuser\">ianburrell</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T17:20:51.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41594123\">5 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41594123\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41592907\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593526\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41593134\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41594123\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">There are a few problems with this. Mesh is cool for other uses but can&#x27;t replace the infrastructure of mobile operator.<p>One, what frequency are you going to use? If you use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, your Wifi-using neighbors will hate you. There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum.<p>Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city. Also, 5G routers are not that cheap. It also means that there will be no reception away from the city. Most routers are meant to be used inside, and good coverage, requires mounting them outside on a pole.<p>Three, I&#x27;m not sure there is 5G device-to-device. There was LTE-Direct but it never got implemented.

Do a fact-check there. ;) I think most diversity antenna systems that you describe use 2. And they are still considered “premium”. 3 is a bit overkill for FM, FM is very resilient against obstacles.<p>If I’m wrong, would be interesting to see an example of a car that uses 3 or more.

Since its antennas are on the outside it should get way better GPS and cellular connectivity than my phone in my pocket deep in a metal box.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41596738&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341596738\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                                    <tr class='athing comtr' id='41594126'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='0'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41594126' href='vote?id=41594126&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=sgt\" class=\"hnuser\">sgt</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T17:21:02.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41594126\">5 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41594126\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593519\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41595257\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41594126\" n=\"2\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Won&#x27;t tapping on the glass disrupt the signal, or simply wind or heavy rain against it disrupt it as well?</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41594126&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341594126\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41596504'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41596504' href='vote?id=41596504&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=zonkerdonker\" class=\"hnuser\">zonkerdonker</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T21:22:23.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41596504\">1 hour ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41596504\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41594126\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41595257\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41596504\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">It would if this was actually mm-wave 5g.

TLDR, skeptical due to the issue of the two 5G frequency ranges.<p>&gt; Because 5G networks include spectrum comprising higher frequencies than 4G, base stations for 5G networks serve a smaller coverage footprint.<p>Sure<p>&gt; It [the window antenna] is compatible with frequencies in the 5G Sub6 band—meaning signals that are less than 6 gigahertz (GHz). Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum.<p>But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also <i>didn’t</i> have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps.<p>The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band.<p>I’m sure there’s some advantage to the 5G tech in general, because it is newer. But that’s a different pitch, right?</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593218&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593218\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593660'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='1'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593660' href='vote?id=41593660&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=toast0\" class=\"hnuser\">toast0</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T16:35:36.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593660\">6 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593660\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593218\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">parent</a> | <a href=\"#41593268\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593660\" n=\"1\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">Sub6 is more or less the same frequencies as 4G. I know there&#x27;s more low frequency (additional spectrum formerly used for over the air TV), and there might be some slightly higher frequency too, but this is the general purpose stuff. The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train&#x2F;transit stations.<p>5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn&#x27;t have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised.<p>Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There&#x27;s plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there&#x27;s no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps. Which is why some antennas look like weird saguaro or palm trees and pine trees. It might be nice to have antennas in windows in office buildings instead hanging on the side, and it might be easier to install as well.</div>\n              <div class='reply'>        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                      <u><a href=\"reply?id=41593660&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552%2341593660\" rel=\"nofollow\">reply</a></u>\n                  </font>\n      </div></div></td></tr>\n        </table></td></tr>\n                  <tr class='athing comtr' id='41593268'><td><table border='0'>  <tr>    <td class='ind' indent='0'><img src=\"s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\"></td><td valign=\"top\" class=\"votelinks\">\n      <center><a id='up_41593268' href='vote?id=41593268&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D41592552'><div class='votearrow' title='upvote'></div></a></center>    </td><td class=\"default\"><div style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px;\"><span class=\"comhead\">\n          <a href=\"user?id=HumblyTossed\" class=\"hnuser\">HumblyTossed</a> <span class=\"age\" title=\"2024-09-19T16:03:25.000000Z\"><a href=\"item?id=41593268\">6 hours ago</a></span> <span id=\"unv_41593268\"></span>          <span class='navs'>\n             | <a href=\"#41593218\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">prev</a> | <a href=\"#41592963\" class=\"clicky\" aria-hidden=\"true\">next</a> <a class=\"togg clicky\" id=\"41593268\" n=\"3\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">[–]</a><span class=\"onstory\"></span>          </span>\n                  </span></div><br><div class=\"comment\">\n                  <div class=\"commtext c00\">That&#x27;s not a glass antenna.

I'm just not convinced in this case. Just looking at the picture it seems neither innocuous nor particularly transparent even thought it's on glass. Maybe they can make the connections less apparent without exposed coax, and maybe they won't need to add (extra) windows on top of windows, and maybe they can make the conductive areas more transparent, but this is only useful as a proof of concept. Let's see what they can do for a commercial product. Usually, there are tens of antennas on a single tower so they can't all look like this. Also, I'm going to assume that you have to keep anyone from getting within 3 meters just due to radiated emissions, so don't go just looking out that window!    reply            avianlyric  5 hours ago    | parent | next  [–]      This is a commercial product, that’s actually been installed and being used. The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass. Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem. This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the inside of a buildings facade, while providing coverage outside the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna. To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.

There are a lot of places in the building where slightly darkened glass panel would not look too out of place, as opposed to a bulky ugly opaque plastic box.

Also, I'm going to assume that you have to keep anyone from getting within 3 meters just due to radiated emissions” Those towers you see with lots of antennas are massive MIMO installations designed for very high capacity and coverage over a wide area. But not all sites need to look like that. In this case, it’s just a small cell designed to improve coverage within a building and/or on a few local streets. Power levels are also much lower, not all that much different to a WiFi base station.

This seems not at all unreasonably subtle to me. Even with the array of feeder lines, yeah, maybe it's not for very high end stash places but for most places this seems ay okay.

The article says it's for the \"sub-6\" 5G bands, a.k.a. normal cellular frequencies, not mmWave. As always, these are non-ionizing frequencies, they pose absolutely zero risk to health or safety unless you're absorbing enough power to be meaningfully heated by it. > How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Assuming an antenna gain of 10 dBi, which seems to be \"normal\" for panel-style antennas in the 5G low band, just short of 30 watts in to the antenna would be safe according to the guidelines the FCC gives us amateur radio operators for \"uncontrolled\" environments if the antenna were aimed directly at a person eight feet away. Obviously in the real world these antennas will be aimed outward so the energy being absorbed by anyone in the building will be significantly less than that. These should not be installed in places someone could directly touch it or the cables feeding it, but there's no reason to believe there's any danger to someone just existing normally in the same room.    reply            kevin_thibedeau  1 hour ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      The patent indicates there is a ground plane on the back layer.

How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it That was my first takeaway from the photo from outside. The kinds of antennas they put on top of buildings routinely run many hundreds to a thousand watts or more of power directionally out into the city. That's fine when you're putting it on equipment outside the building on a controlled access roof pointing away from the occupants in the building. Everyone actually in the beam pattern is going to be far away from the active elements. This design doesn't seem to be incredibly directional especially outwards. You're not going to be able to run much power on that antenna, and now you're going to have it on the inside of metallized glass. A lot of that energy is going to stay in the building. I wouldn't want the desk next to this if it's going to run even 100W.

The point of these small cell sites is usually to improve coverage within the building. Occupational RF exposure is pretty strictly regulated in most countries. I’m sure there is design/installation guidance to ensure they stay well within legal limits.    reply            vel0city  1 hour ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      > The point of these small cell sites is usually to improve coverage within the building That's not what the article is stating.

Many others have done this as well over many years, and have either pivoted (Meraki) or gone out of business and sold their assets to conventional ISPs (Common Networks). The biggest hurdle is that reliably running high performance transmitters is not easy for amateurs, and the payoff for any one transmitter is not that much. I'm going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The \"meshier\" the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem. Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node. The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords.    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      Is it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not. Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there's no centralized management. 5GHz/6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz/900MHz/1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies. Then we're not only going to saturate the bands with people doing whatever they want (within legal limits), we're going to depend on mesh routing through all that noise? There goes your reliability and efficiency of sending data.    reply            throwaway48540  6 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      I'm talking about creating a single mesh network, not a Wifi-like situation with many networks on the same bands.    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      There is no difference in the end. It is still a single collision domain for everyone talking. And who's to say they want to join your mesh and not Bob's super awesome mesh? Or start their own mesh? Oh, you get to decide how to operate the mesh but I can't? I guess you'll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh. You'll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx/rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage. You'll start encouraging people to not put up more nodes in a certain area because it's just getting too crowded here, but hey we need to incentivize someone to set up a node on the other side of town. Snap now it seems like we're running a regular carrier. I participate and use city-sized WiFi mesh networks in the amateur radio world. They're not anywhere near a replacement for what normal people think of as internet connectivity. I can't imagine swapping WiFi for 5G cellular stacks would end up making a radical difference. The issues are largely with having to make multiple wireless hops, mesh routing inefficiencies/problems, and having everyone actually play nice all the time.    reply            gruez  6 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      How do you prevent selfish leechers that use network bandwidth, but don't contribute to it, like on public torrents?

Why would it be part of every modem/gateway? Since there's no monetary incentive to participate, in all likelihood all nodes would be run by volunteers who are shelling out extra for a compatible modem/router. Actually come to think of it, you can run a volunteer network providing internet connectivity with off the shelf equipment right now. It's called setting your wifi network to \"open\". Why don't people do that? How would your mesh network fix those issues?    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      Not only just shelling out more for that compatible modem/router, that volunteer would also have to be willing to set up at least the antennas in a place optimal for others to actually use it instead of potentially optimal placement for their own services. A client on the street is not going to get good connectivity to someone's cell repeater tucked deep in their media cabinet next to their game console and under their TV in the center of their home. You'll need to get your volunteers to bother placing these antennas on their roofs, on the top of flagpoles, etc. to get good propagation.

Those regular WiFi networks only have tons of available bandwidth because they're not trying to repeat a bunch of wireless traffic. Even the current mesh WiFi networks only really work when you're using frequencies that aren't trying to compete with neighbors. Start getting actual density and it'll all fall apart. Also your idea of \"standard QoS can still apply\" isn't exactly true. That QoS is only going to work if people play along with it. In the end its a shared medium. Get some clients to not play along with your configurations, you'll start getting collisions regardless of what you configure your QoS settings.    reply            ianburrell  5 hours ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      If it isn't doing mesh routing, then it isn't a mesh.

There is a volunteer-driven LoRaWAN Helium[0] mesh network which added 5G some 2 years back. But it's cryptocurrency-driven and apparently unprofitable for volunteers investing in radios and antennas. At least where I live. My neighbor still has the Helium antenna and radio on his balcony but it's offline due to costs/profits disproportion. It's the LoRaWAN, pre-5G hardware though, and I don't know anyone running the 5G version, if it's even a real thing. I liked the idea from technical perspective but the project itself was off-putting for me due to being built around a crypto token and having overall web3 smell.

Mesh is cool for other uses but can't replace the infrastructure of mobile operator. One, what frequency are you going to use? If you use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, your Wifi-using neighbors will hate you. There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum. Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city.

Sure > It [the window antenna] is compatible with frequencies in the 5G Sub6 band—meaning signals that are less than 6 gigahertz (GHz). Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum. But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also didn’t have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps. The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band. I’m sure there’s some advantage to the 5G tech in general, because it is newer. But that’s a different pitch, right?    reply            toast0  6 hours ago    | parent | next  [–]      Sub6 is more or less the same frequencies as 4G. I know there's more low frequency (additional spectrum formerly used for over the air TV), and there might be some slightly higher frequency too, but this is the general purpose stuff. The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train/transit stations. 5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn't have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised. Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There's plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there's no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps. Which is why some antennas look like weird saguaro or palm trees and pine trees.

The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass. Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem. This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the inside of a buildings facade, while providing coverage outside the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna. To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.

The article says it's for the \"sub-6\" 5G bands, a.k.a. normal cellular frequencies, not mmWave. As always, these are non-ionizing frequencies, they pose absolutely zero risk to health or safety unless you're absorbing enough power to be meaningfully heated by it. > How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Assuming an antenna gain of 10 dBi, which seems to be \"normal\" for panel-style antennas in the 5G low band, just short of 30 watts in to the antenna would be safe according to the guidelines the FCC gives us amateur radio operators for \"uncontrolled\" environments if the antenna were aimed directly at a person eight feet away. Obviously in the real world these antennas will be aimed outward so the energy being absorbed by anyone in the building will be significantly less than that. These should not be installed in places someone could directly touch it or the cables feeding it, but there's no reason to believe there's any danger to someone just existing normally in the same room.    reply            kevin_thibedeau  1 hour ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      The patent indicates there is a ground plane on the back layer.

Many others have done this as well over many years, and have either pivoted (Meraki) or gone out of business and sold their assets to conventional ISPs (Common Networks). The biggest hurdle is that reliably running high performance transmitters is not easy for amateurs, and the payoff for any one transmitter is not that much. I'm going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The \"meshier\" the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem. Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node. The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords.    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      Is it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not. Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there's no centralized management. 5GHz/6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz/900MHz/1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies. Then we're not only going to saturate the bands with people doing whatever they want (within legal limits), we're going to depend on mesh routing through all that noise?

Oh, you get to decide how to operate the mesh but I can't? I guess you'll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh. You'll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx/rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage. You'll start encouraging people to not put up more nodes in a certain area because it's just getting too crowded here, but hey we need to incentivize someone to set up a node on the other side of town. Snap now it seems like we're running a regular carrier. I participate and use city-sized WiFi mesh networks in the amateur radio world. They're not anywhere near a replacement for what normal people think of as internet connectivity. I can't imagine swapping WiFi for 5G cellular stacks would end up making a radical difference.

Since there's no monetary incentive to participate, in all likelihood all nodes would be run by volunteers who are shelling out extra for a compatible modem/router.

Those regular WiFi networks only have tons of available bandwidth because they're not trying to repeat a bunch of wireless traffic. Even the current mesh WiFi networks only really work when you're using frequencies that aren't trying to compete with neighbors. Start getting actual density and it'll all fall apart. Also your idea of \"standard QoS can still apply\" isn't exactly true. That QoS is only going to work if people play along with it. In the end its a shared medium.

Mesh is cool for other uses but can't replace the infrastructure of mobile operator. One, what frequency are you going to use? If you use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, your Wifi-using neighbors will hate you. There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum. Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city. Also, 5G routers are not that cheap. It also means that there will be no reception away from the city. Most routers are meant to be used inside, and good coverage, requires mounting them outside on a pole. Three, I'm not sure there is 5G device-to-device.

Sure > It [the window antenna] is compatible with frequencies in the 5G Sub6 band—meaning signals that are less than 6 gigahertz (GHz). Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum. But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also didn’t have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps. The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band. I’m sure there’s some advantage to the 5G tech in general, because it is newer. But that’s a different pitch, right?    reply            toast0  6 hours ago    | parent | next  [–]      Sub6 is more or less the same frequencies as 4G. I know there's more low frequency (additional spectrum formerly used for over the air TV), and there might be some slightly higher frequency too, but this is the general purpose stuff. The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train/transit stations. 5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn't have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised. Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There's plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there's no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps. Which is why some antennas look like weird saguaro or palm trees and pine trees.

Let's see what they can do for a commercial product. Usually, there are tens of antennas on a single tower so they can't all look like this.

The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass. Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem. This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the inside of a buildings facade, while providing coverage outside the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna. To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.

The article says it's for the \"sub-6\" 5G bands, a.k.a. normal cellular frequencies, not mmWave. As always, these are non-ionizing frequencies, they pose absolutely zero risk to health or safety unless you're absorbing enough power to be meaningfully heated by it. > How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Assuming an antenna gain of 10 dBi, which seems to be \"normal\" for panel-style antennas in the 5G low band, just short of 30 watts in to the antenna would be safe according to the guidelines the FCC gives us amateur radio operators for \"uncontrolled\" environments if the antenna were aimed directly at a person eight feet away. Obviously in the real world these antennas will be aimed outward so the energy being absorbed by anyone in the building will be significantly less than that.

That's fine when you're putting it on equipment outside the building on a controlled access roof pointing away from the occupants in the building.

Many others have done this as well over many years, and have either pivoted (Meraki) or gone out of business and sold their assets to conventional ISPs (Common Networks). The biggest hurdle is that reliably running high performance transmitters is not easy for amateurs, and the payoff for any one transmitter is not that much. I'm going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The \"meshier\" the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem. Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node. The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords.    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      Is it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not. Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there's no centralized management. 5GHz/6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz/900MHz/1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies.

I guess you'll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh. You'll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx/rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage.

There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it.

Sure > It [the window antenna] is compatible with frequencies in the 5G Sub6 band—meaning signals that are less than 6 gigahertz (GHz). Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum. But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also didn’t have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps. The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band. I’m sure there’s some advantage to the 5G tech in general, because it is newer. But that’s a different pitch, right?    reply            toast0  6 hours ago    | parent | next  [–]      Sub6 is more or less the same frequencies as 4G. I know there's more low frequency (additional spectrum formerly used for over the air TV), and there might be some slightly higher frequency too, but this is the general purpose stuff. The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train/transit stations. 5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn't have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised. Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There's plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there's no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps. Which is why some antennas look like weird saguaro or palm trees and pine trees.

The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass. Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem. This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the inside of a buildings facade, while providing coverage outside the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna. To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.

The article says it's for the \"sub-6\" 5G bands, a.k.a. normal cellular frequencies, not mmWave. As always, these are non-ionizing frequencies, they pose absolutely zero risk to health or safety unless you're absorbing enough power to be meaningfully heated by it. > How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Assuming an antenna gain of 10 dBi, which seems to be \"normal\" for panel-style antennas in the 5G low band, just short of 30 watts in to the antenna would be safe according to the guidelines the FCC gives us amateur radio operators for \"uncontrolled\" environments if the antenna were aimed directly at a person eight feet away. Obviously in the real world these antennas will be aimed outward so the energy being absorbed by anyone in the building will be significantly less than that.

That's fine when you're putting it on equipment outside the building on a controlled access roof pointing away from the occupants in the building.

Many others have done this as well over many years, and have either pivoted (Meraki) or gone out of business and sold their assets to conventional ISPs (Common Networks). The biggest hurdle is that reliably running high performance transmitters is not easy for amateurs, and the payoff for any one transmitter is not that much. I'm going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The \"meshier\" the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem. Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node. The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords.    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      Is it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not. Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there's no centralized management. 5GHz/6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz/900MHz/1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies. Then we're not only going to saturate the bands with people doing whatever they want (within legal limits), we're going to depend on mesh routing through all that noise?

It is still a single collision domain for everyone talking. And who's to say they want to join your mesh and not Bob's super awesome mesh? Or start their own mesh? Oh, you get to decide how to operate the mesh but I can't? I guess you'll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh. You'll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx/rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage. You'll start encouraging people to not put up more nodes in a certain area because it's just getting too crowded here, but hey we need to incentivize someone to set up a node on the other side of town. Snap now it seems like we're running a regular carrier. I participate and use city-sized WiFi mesh networks in the amateur radio world. They're not anywhere near a replacement for what normal people think of as internet connectivity. I can't imagine swapping WiFi for 5G cellular stacks would end up making a radical difference.

Since there's no monetary incentive to participate, in all likelihood all nodes would be run by volunteers who are shelling out extra for a compatible modem/router.

Those regular WiFi networks only have tons of available bandwidth because they're not trying to repeat a bunch of wireless traffic. Even the current mesh WiFi networks only really work when you're using frequencies that aren't trying to compete with neighbors. Start getting actual density and it'll all fall apart. Also your idea of \"standard QoS can still apply\" isn't exactly true. That QoS is only going to work if people play along with it. In the end its a shared medium.

Mesh is cool for other uses but can't replace the infrastructure of mobile operator. One, what frequency are you going to use? If you use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, your Wifi-using neighbors will hate you. There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum. Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city. Also, 5G routers are not that cheap. It also means that there will be no reception away from the city. Most routers are meant to be used inside, and good coverage, requires mounting them outside on a pole. Three, I'm not sure there is 5G device-to-device.

Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum. But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also didn’t have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps. The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band.

The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train/transit stations. 5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn't have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised. Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There's plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there's no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps. Which is why some antennas look like weird saguaro or palm trees and pine trees.

I'm just not convinced in this case. Just looking at the picture it seems neither innocuous nor particularly transparent even thought it's on glass. Maybe they can make the connections less apparent without exposed coax, and maybe they won't need to add (extra) windows on top of windows, and maybe they can make the conductive areas more transparent, but this is only useful as a proof of concept. Let's see what they can do for a commercial product. Usually, there are tens of antennas on a single tower so they can't all look like this.

The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass. Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem. This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the inside of a buildings facade, while providing coverage outside the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna. To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.

The article says it's for the \"sub-6\" 5G bands, a.k.a. normal cellular frequencies, not mmWave. As always, these are non-ionizing frequencies, they pose absolutely zero risk to health or safety unless you're absorbing enough power to be meaningfully heated by it. > How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Assuming an antenna gain of 10 dBi, which seems to be \"normal\" for panel-style antennas in the 5G low band, just short of 30 watts in to the antenna would be safe according to the guidelines the FCC gives us amateur radio operators for \"uncontrolled\" environments if the antenna were aimed directly at a person eight feet away. Obviously in the real world these antennas will be aimed outward so the energy being absorbed by anyone in the building will be significantly less than that. These should not be installed in places someone could directly touch it or the cables feeding it, but there's no reason to believe there's any danger to someone just existing normally in the same room.    reply            kevin_thibedeau  1 hour ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      The patent indicates there is a ground plane on the back layer.

The kinds of antennas they put on top of buildings routinely run many hundreds to a thousand watts or more of power directionally out into the city. That's fine when you're putting it on equipment outside the building on a controlled access roof pointing away from the occupants in the building.

Many others have done this as well over many years, and have either pivoted (Meraki) or gone out of business and sold their assets to conventional ISPs (Common Networks). The biggest hurdle is that reliably running high performance transmitters is not easy for amateurs, and the payoff for any one transmitter is not that much. I'm going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The \"meshier\" the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem. Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node. The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords.    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      Is it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not. Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there's no centralized management. 5GHz/6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz/900MHz/1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies. Then we're not only going to saturate the bands with people doing whatever they want (within legal limits), we're going to depend on mesh routing through all that noise?

I guess you'll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh. You'll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx/rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage. You'll start encouraging people to not put up more nodes in a certain area because it's just getting too crowded here, but hey we need to incentivize someone to set up a node on the other side of town. Snap now it seems like we're running a regular carrier. I participate and use city-sized WiFi mesh networks in the amateur radio world. They're not anywhere near a replacement for what normal people think of as internet connectivity. I can't imagine swapping WiFi for 5G cellular stacks would end up making a radical difference.

Those regular WiFi networks only have tons of available bandwidth because they're not trying to repeat a bunch of wireless traffic. Even the current mesh WiFi networks only really work when you're using frequencies that aren't trying to compete with neighbors. Start getting actual density and it'll all fall apart.

Mesh is cool for other uses but can't replace the infrastructure of mobile operator. One, what frequency are you going to use? If you use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, your Wifi-using neighbors will hate you. There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum. Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city. Also, 5G routers are not that cheap. It also means that there will be no reception away from the city. Most routers are meant to be used inside, and good coverage, requires mounting them outside on a pole. Three, I'm not sure there is 5G device-to-device.

Sure > It [the window antenna] is compatible with frequencies in the 5G Sub6 band—meaning signals that are less than 6 gigahertz (GHz). Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum. But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also didn’t have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps. The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band. I’m sure there’s some advantage to the 5G tech in general, because it is newer. But that’s a different pitch, right?    reply            toast0  6 hours ago    | parent | next  [–]      Sub6 is more or less the same frequencies as 4G. I know there's more low frequency (additional spectrum formerly used for over the air TV), and there might be some slightly higher frequency too, but this is the general purpose stuff. The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train/transit stations. 5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn't have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised. Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There's plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there's no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps. Which is why some antennas look like weird saguaro or palm trees and pine trees.

The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass. Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem. This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the inside of a buildings facade, while providing coverage outside the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna. To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.

The article says it's for the \"sub-6\" 5G bands, a.k.a. normal cellular frequencies, not mmWave. As always, these are non-ionizing frequencies, they pose absolutely zero risk to health or safety unless you're absorbing enough power to be meaningfully heated by it. > How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Assuming an antenna gain of 10 dBi, which seems to be \"normal\" for panel-style antennas in the 5G low band, just short of 30 watts in to the antenna would be safe according to the guidelines the FCC gives us amateur radio operators for \"uncontrolled\" environments if the antenna were aimed directly at a person eight feet away. Obviously in the real world these antennas will be aimed outward so the energy being absorbed by anyone in the building will be significantly less than that.

Many others have done this as well over many years, and have either pivoted (Meraki) or gone out of business and sold their assets to conventional ISPs (Common Networks). The biggest hurdle is that reliably running high performance transmitters is not easy for amateurs, and the payoff for any one transmitter is not that much. I'm going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The \"meshier\" the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem. Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node. The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords.    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      Is it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not. Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there's no centralized management. 5GHz/6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz/900MHz/1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies. Then we're not only going to saturate the bands with people doing whatever they want (within legal limits), we're going to depend on mesh routing through all that noise? There goes your reliability and efficiency of sending data.    reply            throwaway48540  6 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      I'm talking about creating a single mesh network, not a Wifi-like situation with many networks on the same bands.    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      There is no difference in the end. It is still a single collision domain for everyone talking. And who's to say they want to join your mesh and not Bob's super awesome mesh? Or start their own mesh? Oh, you get to decide how to operate the mesh but I can't? I guess you'll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh. You'll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx/rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage. You'll start encouraging people to not put up more nodes in a certain area because it's just getting too crowded here, but hey we need to incentivize someone to set up a node on the other side of town. Snap now it seems like we're running a regular carrier. I participate and use city-sized WiFi mesh networks in the amateur radio world. They're not anywhere near a replacement for what normal people think of as internet connectivity. I can't imagine swapping WiFi for 5G cellular stacks would end up making a radical difference.

Since there's no monetary incentive to participate, in all likelihood all nodes would be run by volunteers who are shelling out extra for a compatible modem/router.

Those regular WiFi networks only have tons of available bandwidth because they're not trying to repeat a bunch of wireless traffic. Even the current mesh WiFi networks only really work when you're using frequencies that aren't trying to compete with neighbors. Start getting actual density and it'll all fall apart. Also your idea of \"standard QoS can still apply\" isn't exactly true. That QoS is only going to work if people play along with it. In the end its a shared medium.

Mesh is cool for other uses but can't replace the infrastructure of mobile operator. One, what frequency are you going to use? If you use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, your Wifi-using neighbors will hate you. There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum. Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city. Also, 5G routers are not that cheap. It also means that there will be no reception away from the city. Most routers are meant to be used inside, and good coverage, requires mounting them outside on a pole. Three, I'm not sure there is 5G device-to-device.

Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum. But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also didn’t have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps. The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band.

But that’s a different pitch, right?    reply            toast0  6 hours ago    | parent | next  [–]      Sub6 is more or less the same frequencies as 4G. I know there's more low frequency (additional spectrum formerly used for over the air TV), and there might be some slightly higher frequency too, but this is the general purpose stuff. The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train/transit stations. 5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn't have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised. Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There's plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there's no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps. Which is why some antennas look like weird saguaro or palm trees and pine trees.

I'm just not convinced in this case. Just looking at the picture it seems neither innocuous nor particularly transparent even thought it's on glass. Maybe they can make the connections less apparent without exposed coax, and maybe they won't need to add (extra) windows on top of windows, and maybe they can make the conductive areas more transparent, but this is only useful as a proof of concept. Let's see what they can do for a commercial product. Usually, there are tens of antennas on a single tower so they can't all look like this.

The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass. Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem. This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the inside of a buildings facade, while providing coverage outside the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna. To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.

The article says it's for the \"sub-6\" 5G bands, a.k.a. normal cellular frequencies, not mmWave. As always, these are non-ionizing frequencies, they pose absolutely zero risk to health or safety unless you're absorbing enough power to be meaningfully heated by it. > How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Assuming an antenna gain of 10 dBi, which seems to be \"normal\" for panel-style antennas in the 5G low band, just short of 30 watts in to the antenna would be safe according to the guidelines the FCC gives us amateur radio operators for \"uncontrolled\" environments if the antenna were aimed directly at a person eight feet away. Obviously in the real world these antennas will be aimed outward so the energy being absorbed by anyone in the building will be significantly less than that. These should not be installed in places someone could directly touch it or the cables feeding it, but there's no reason to believe there's any danger to someone just existing normally in the same room.    reply            kevin_thibedeau  1 hour ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      The patent indicates there is a ground plane on the back layer.

The kinds of antennas they put on top of buildings routinely run many hundreds to a thousand watts or more of power directionally out into the city. That's fine when you're putting it on equipment outside the building on a controlled access roof pointing away from the occupants in the building. Everyone actually in the beam pattern is going to be far away from the active elements. This design doesn't seem to be incredibly directional especially outwards.

Many others have done this as well over many years, and have either pivoted (Meraki) or gone out of business and sold their assets to conventional ISPs (Common Networks). The biggest hurdle is that reliably running high performance transmitters is not easy for amateurs, and the payoff for any one transmitter is not that much. I'm going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The \"meshier\" the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem. Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node. The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords.    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      Is it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not. Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there's no centralized management. 5GHz/6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz/900MHz/1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies. Then we're not only going to saturate the bands with people doing whatever they want (within legal limits), we're going to depend on mesh routing through all that noise?

Oh, you get to decide how to operate the mesh but I can't? I guess you'll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh. You'll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx/rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage. You'll start encouraging people to not put up more nodes in a certain area because it's just getting too crowded here, but hey we need to incentivize someone to set up a node on the other side of town. Snap now it seems like we're running a regular carrier. I participate and use city-sized WiFi mesh networks in the amateur radio world. They're not anywhere near a replacement for what normal people think of as internet connectivity. I can't imagine swapping WiFi for 5G cellular stacks would end up making a radical difference.

Those regular WiFi networks only have tons of available bandwidth because they're not trying to repeat a bunch of wireless traffic. Even the current mesh WiFi networks only really work when you're using frequencies that aren't trying to compete with neighbors. Start getting actual density and it'll all fall apart. Also your idea of \"standard QoS can still apply\" isn't exactly true. That QoS is only going to work if people play along with it. In the end its a shared medium.

Mesh is cool for other uses but can't replace the infrastructure of mobile operator. One, what frequency are you going to use? If you use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, your Wifi-using neighbors will hate you. There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum. Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city. Also, 5G routers are not that cheap. It also means that there will be no reception away from the city. Most routers are meant to be used inside, and good coverage, requires mounting them outside on a pole. Three, I'm not sure there is 5G device-to-device.

Sure > It [the window antenna] is compatible with frequencies in the 5G Sub6 band—meaning signals that are less than 6 gigahertz (GHz). Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum. But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also didn’t have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps. The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band.

But that’s a different pitch, right?    reply            toast0  6 hours ago    | parent | next  [–]      Sub6 is more or less the same frequencies as 4G. I know there's more low frequency (additional spectrum formerly used for over the air TV), and there might be some slightly higher frequency too, but this is the general purpose stuff. The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train/transit stations. 5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn't have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised. Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There's plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there's no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps.

Let's see what they can do for a commercial product. Usually, there are tens of antennas on a single tower so they can't all look like this.

The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass. Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem. This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the inside of a buildings facade, while providing coverage outside the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna. To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.

The article says it's for the \"sub-6\" 5G bands, a.k.a. normal cellular frequencies, not mmWave. As always, these are non-ionizing frequencies, they pose absolutely zero risk to health or safety unless you're absorbing enough power to be meaningfully heated by it. > How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Assuming an antenna gain of 10 dBi, which seems to be \"normal\" for panel-style antennas in the 5G low band, just short of 30 watts in to the antenna would be safe according to the guidelines the FCC gives us amateur radio operators for \"uncontrolled\" environments if the antenna were aimed directly at a person eight feet away. Obviously in the real world these antennas will be aimed outward so the energy being absorbed by anyone in the building will be significantly less than that.

I'm going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The \"meshier\" the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem. Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node. The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords.    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      Is it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not. Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there's no centralized management. 5GHz/6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz/900MHz/1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies. Then we're not only going to saturate the bands with people doing whatever they want (within legal limits), we're going to depend on mesh routing through all that noise?

Oh, you get to decide how to operate the mesh but I can't? I guess you'll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh. You'll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx/rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage. You'll start encouraging people to not put up more nodes in a certain area because it's just getting too crowded here, but hey we need to incentivize someone to set up a node on the other side of town. Snap now it seems like we're running a regular carrier. I participate and use city-sized WiFi mesh networks in the amateur radio world. They're not anywhere near a replacement for what normal people think of as internet connectivity. I can't imagine swapping WiFi for 5G cellular stacks would end up making a radical difference.

Those regular WiFi networks only have tons of available bandwidth because they're not trying to repeat a bunch of wireless traffic. Even the current mesh WiFi networks only really work when you're using frequencies that aren't trying to compete with neighbors. Start getting actual density and it'll all fall apart.

Mesh is cool for other uses but can't replace the infrastructure of mobile operator. One, what frequency are you going to use? If you use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, your Wifi-using neighbors will hate you. There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum. Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city. Also, 5G routers are not that cheap. It also means that there will be no reception away from the city. Most routers are meant to be used inside, and good coverage, requires mounting them outside on a pole. Three, I'm not sure there is 5G device-to-device.

Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum. But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also didn’t have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps. The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band.

But that’s a different pitch, right?    reply            toast0  6 hours ago    | parent | next  [–]      Sub6 is more or less the same frequencies as 4G. I know there's more low frequency (additional spectrum formerly used for over the air TV), and there might be some slightly higher frequency too, but this is the general purpose stuff. The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train/transit stations. 5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn't have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised. Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There's plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there's no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps. Which is why some antennas look like weird saguaro or palm trees and pine trees.

The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass. Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem. This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the inside of a buildings facade, while providing coverage outside the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna. To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.

The article says it's for the \"sub-6\" 5G bands, a.k.a. normal cellular frequencies, not mmWave. As always, these are non-ionizing frequencies, they pose absolutely zero risk to health or safety unless you're absorbing enough power to be meaningfully heated by it. > How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Assuming an antenna gain of 10 dBi, which seems to be \"normal\" for panel-style antennas in the 5G low band, just short of 30 watts in to the antenna would be safe according to the guidelines the FCC gives us amateur radio operators for \"uncontrolled\" environments if the antenna were aimed directly at a person eight feet away. Obviously in the real world these antennas will be aimed outward so the energy being absorbed by anyone in the building will be significantly less than that. These should not be installed in places someone could directly touch it or the cables feeding it, but there's no reason to believe there's any danger to someone just existing normally in the same room.    reply            kevin_thibedeau  1 hour ago    | root | parent | prev | next  [–]      The patent indicates there is a ground plane on the back layer.

The kinds of antennas they put on top of buildings routinely run many hundreds to a thousand watts or more of power directionally out into the city. That's fine when you're putting it on equipment outside the building on a controlled access roof pointing away from the occupants in the building.

Many others have done this as well over many years, and have either pivoted (Meraki) or gone out of business and sold their assets to conventional ISPs (Common Networks). The biggest hurdle is that reliably running high performance transmitters is not easy for amateurs, and the payoff for any one transmitter is not that much. I'm going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The \"meshier\" the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem. Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node. The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords.    reply            vel0city  6 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      Is it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not. Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there's no centralized management. 5GHz/6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz/900MHz/1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies. Then we're not only going to saturate the bands with people doing whatever they want (within legal limits), we're going to depend on mesh routing through all that noise?

Oh, you get to decide how to operate the mesh but I can't? I guess you'll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh. You'll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx/rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage. You'll start encouraging people to not put up more nodes in a certain area because it's just getting too crowded here, but hey we need to incentivize someone to set up a node on the other side of town. Snap now it seems like we're running a regular carrier. I participate and use city-sized WiFi mesh networks in the amateur radio world.

Those regular WiFi networks only have tons of available bandwidth because they're not trying to repeat a bunch of wireless traffic. Even the current mesh WiFi networks only really work when you're using frequencies that aren't trying to compete with neighbors. Start getting actual density and it'll all fall apart.

There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum. Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city. Also, 5G routers are not that cheap. It also means that there will be no reception away from the city.

Maybe even WiFi — weird as it sounds, I saw some strings for WiFi antennas in a popular stock media/head unit’s firmware. Though you are probably right and many cars with just FM/AM and DAB still put them in windshields. I’m not sure about that 3+ antenna claim for FM. Do a fact-check there. ;) I think most diversity antenna systems that you describe use 2. And they are still considered “premium”. 3 is a bit overkill for FM, FM is very resilient against obstacles. If I’m wrong, would be interesting to see an example of a car that uses 3 or more. Probably far outside of my pay grade to say the least.    reply            HPsquared  5 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      I'm going by the BMW E90 (Top HiFi option) which has 3 physical FM antennas FM1, FM2 and FM3, all in the rear glass, and a fourth \"FM4\" which is not a physical antenna but a combination of FM1 and FM2. They really didn't want you losing signal! This isn't even mentioning the festoon of other antennas for DAB, mobile (which has a backup too and phones home in a crash: in case the shark fin is broken in a crash)    reply            caseyy  2 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      I could be wrong, but E90 with the best HiFi package is a very rare exception to the rule.

My car can connect to my home's WiFi for its software updates. I doubt that antenna is inside the cabin of the car. It also can act as a hotspot if I bothered paying for its data plan.

The article says this antenna only functions in the sub 5ghz range, which makes a lot of sense. Most modern windows use an aluminuzed coating for UV reflection (usually called low-e glass), which surprise surprise, is absolutely great at attenuating mm-wave frequencies, making windows pretty much the worst possible place on a building to place an antenna.

TLDR, skeptical due to the issue of the two 5G frequency ranges. > Because 5G networks include spectrum comprising higher frequencies than 4G, base stations for 5G networks serve a smaller coverage footprint. Sure > It [the window antenna] is compatible with frequencies in the 5G Sub6 band—meaning signals that are less than 6 gigahertz (GHz). Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum. But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also didn’t have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps. The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band. I’m sure there’s some advantage to the 5G tech in general, because it is newer. But that’s a different pitch, right?    reply            toast0  6 hours ago    | parent | next  [–]      Sub6 is more or less the same frequencies as 4G. I know there's more low frequency (additional spectrum formerly used for over the air TV), and there might be some slightly higher frequency too, but this is the general purpose stuff. The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train/transit stations. 5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn't have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised. Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There's plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there's no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps. Which is why some antennas look like weird saguaro or palm trees and pine trees. It might be nice to have antennas in windows in office buildings instead hanging on the side, and it might be easier to install as well.    reply            HumblyTossed  6 hours ago    | prev | next  [–]      That's not a glass antenna.

You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna. To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.

This seems not at all unreasonably subtle to me. Even with the array of feeder lines, yeah, maybe it's not for very high end stash places but for most places this seems ay okay. Given what the alternatives are for urban and commercial spaces, this feels like a big win. My main concern is power level. How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Also, what frequencies is this antenna designed for; it seems like 5g can run on lots of spectrum; is this mmWave gear or lower?

Assuming an antenna gain of 10 dBi, which seems to be \"normal\" for panel-style antennas in the 5G low band, just short of 30 watts in to the antenna would be safe according to the guidelines the FCC gives us amateur radio operators for \"uncontrolled\" environments if the antenna were aimed directly at a person eight feet away. Obviously in the real world these antennas will be aimed outward so the energy being absorbed by anyone in the building will be significantly less than that. These should not be installed in places someone could directly touch it or the cables feeding it, but there's no reason to believe there's any danger to someone just existing normally in the same room.    reply           wolrah  6 hours ago    | root | parent | next  [–]      > Also, what frequencies is this antenna designed for; it seems like 5g can run on lots of spectrum; is this mmWave gear or lower?

Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node. The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node.

Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not. Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands.

Mesh is cool for other uses but can't replace the infrastructure of mobile operator. One, what frequency are you going to use? If you use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, your Wifi-using neighbors will hate you. There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum. Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city. Also, 5G routers are not that cheap. It also means that there will be no reception away from the city. Most routers are meant to be used inside, and good coverage, requires mounting them outside on a pole. Three, I'm not sure there is 5G device-to-device. There was LTE-Direct but it never got implemented. There D2D in 5G spec but I can't find any implementations.    reply           ianburrell  5 hours ago    | parent | prev | next  [–]      There are a few problems with this.

Maybe even WiFi — weird as it sounds, I saw some strings for WiFi antennas in a popular stock media/head unit’s firmware. Though you are probably right and many cars with just FM/AM and DAB still put them in windshields. I’m not sure about that 3+ antenna claim for FM. Do a fact-check there. ;) I think most diversity antenna systems that you describe use 2. And they are still considered “premium”. 3 is a bit overkill for FM, FM is very resilient against obstacles. If I’m wrong, would be interesting to see an example of a car that uses 3 or more.

Most modern windows use an aluminuzed coating for UV reflection (usually called low-e glass), which surprise surprise, is absolutely great at attenuating mm-wave frequencies, making windows pretty much the worst possible place on a building to place an antenna.

Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum. But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also didn’t have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps. The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band.
